A further aspect of this mission is that the production processes for the anode, cathode, electrolyte solutions and binders as well as cell production will be sustainable, energy-efficient and demonstrated at industrial mass manufacturing scale. Combining all of this leads to a non-lithium modular battery system with favourable CAPEX (< 150 €/kW storage capacity), OPEX (approx. 0.03 €/kWh/cycle) and carbon footprint (<100kgCO2eq/kWh), enabling energy storage applications, ranging from domestic installations (multiple units of 6.2 kWh/unit to be demonstrated in the project with projections towards large utility installations of multiple MWh. As a consequence, this will establish a European-based, globally competitive battery supply- and value chain that supports economic prosperity and the net-zero transition. The integrated material-manufacturing and sustainability assessment approach in EPISODE will transform the existing (Li) battery manufacturing process into a sustainable one to meet the future needs of the sustainable and resilient EU battery industry. In EPISODE, the project objectives will be achieved by a strong alliance among physics, chemistry and materials science researchers from both academia and industry (UMI, ARK, UPC, ISE), academic battery cell producers (CID, WMG) and industrial module manufacturers (FAAM), end-users (EGP, EnelX, EnBW, Senec) as well as expertise in environmental assessments (UAH, KIT) and experts in project management and communication and dissemination activities (UNR).|10.3030/101191867|Cluster 5

SAGELi’s new cathode active materials (CAM) contain no Co. They are based on inherently-safe Mn-rich oxides. Additional safety will be ensured by reducing CAMs’ active surface area and an innovative coating. SAGELi’s safer binders target better adhesion, lower swelling and better processability to prevent safety issues from cracking and inhomogeneities. SAGELi’s flame-retardant electrolytes target stability at high voltage. SAGELi’s Flash Thermal Test will predict safety from just a few grams of novel materials, eliminating the need for upscaling to determine safety. SAGELi’s State of Safety Early Prediction Tool will predict EUCAR level during battery operation and ageing. SAGELi’s pouch cells will be demonstrated at 25 mAh and 5 Ah scale, and all SAGELi materials and cells are fully scalable and recyclable via existing processes.The consortium gathers (i) 5 top public research organisations whose previous results have been used in commercial batteries (CEA, FZJ, CNRS, CID, CICe); (ii) 7 companies committed to bringing SAGELi to market in existing and future factories across the EU for sales to customers worldwide: Umicore for CAM, Arkema for binder and electrolyte, Ccell for cells, Power4Future for batteries, FINCANTIERI for electric ships and THALES for electric aircraft equipment; and (ii) EU electromobility association, AVERE.SAGELi’s raw material cost is 23% lower than NMC811. SAGELI’s market penetration in 2030 is expected to generate ~1.4 bn€ of revenues for SAGELi’s EU partners by 2030 and >20.2bn€ in 2035. Its materials are expected to be used in 40GWh of batteries produced in 2030, 600GWh produced in 2035, and 700 GWh produced in 2040, providing a cumulative 1.9Mt C02eq savings vs NMC811.

Decades of indifference and neglect, gaps in our understanding of its aetiology and diagnosis, inadequate therapeutic approaches to pain and infertility, and relatively high uptake of unproven self-management strategies characterise the disease. Using a multipronged approach, our project aims to address critical unmet clinical needs around endometriosis. With involvement of patient organisations and patients with diverse real-life experiences across Europe, we will explore how patients perceive self-management in the light of existing stigma and dismissal in clinical interactions. We will conduct a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of dietary intervention and cognitive behavioural therapy on endometriosis-related pain and subfertility, aiming at developing new treatment options and practical tools. Analysing steroid metabolomics and microRNA profiling will provide a powerful diagnostic approach able to predict the effectiveness of interventions and likelihood of recurrence, while investigating the link between microbiota health, local epigenetic alterations, immune response and endometriosis development will yield a better understanding of disease mechanisms. Utilising eHealth-based technologies and AI/machine learning, we will also develop models that can predict responses to lifestyle behaviours. Project outcomes will empower affected patients to make and shape decisions for their own health, educate the general public about endometriosis and its heavy burden, and reduce stigmatisation, encouraging more individuals to seek help.|10.3030/101157146|Cluster Health

Nevertheless, these groups are invariably excluded from pandemic preparedness and response research, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our ambition is to develop a dedicated pregnancy-infant preparedness platform for adaptive trials, to improve pandemic preparedness for these underserved populations.The objectives of PIPELINE are to: 1) establish a multi-country adaptive trials platform that that can support novel diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for infections in pregnancy and infancy, able to pivot rapidly to emerging health threats; 2) create and sustain a responsive and “ever-warm” clinical trial network of sites with expertise in recruiting pregnant women and infants and adaptive trial designs; 3) undertake an adaptive platform trial on respiratory syncytial virus immunisation in pregnant women and infants, to test the platform’s capabilities and address a public health priority for the EU; 4) evaluate novel sampling techniques and immunity approaches with relevance for preparedness; and 5) embed all activities within sustained dissemination, exploitation and communication with key stakeholders to translate results into policy recommendations.We will achieve these objectives through our multidisciplinary partnership with track records in maternal and infant health research, who will leverage and strengthen existing networks to maximise Europe-wide outreach to benefit PIPELINE. Our objectives are aligned with Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-24 Health Destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden” as our work will reduce the health burden of disease through more effective management, lead to improved preparedness of health systems to respond to health emergencies, and reduce citizens’ risk of, and increase their knowledge about, health threats of epidemics.|10.3030/101155852|Cluster Health

Earlier diagnosis means earlier access to preventive interventions, which are now more effective thanks to next-generation immunotherapies. The clinical use of these new drugs is not consensual though, because of the severe side-effects they inflict in some patients. FluiDx-AD tests offer a pioneering tool to stratify and monitor patients eligible for these drugs, towards reducing their associated risk and accelerating their regulatory clearance in the EU.FluiDx-AD tests are thus devised to work complementarily and sequentially, covering the full AD diagnostic journey (from population-wide screenings to confirmatory diagnosis, and downstream patient stratification and monitoring), tackling key challenges of early AD diagnosis and AD prevention with new drugs, while also paving the way for the development of new therapies by streamlining patient selection and appraisal in clinical trials.FluiDx-AD brings together a team of highly motivated, committed, and reputed entrepreneurs, clinicians, and scientists from biotechs, hospitals, academic centres, and patient organizations across the EU. Leveraging our unique blend of trans-disciplinary/-sectoral expertise and access to advanced technologies and infrastructures, we join forces to realize the vision of a new era of AD clinical management for the benefit of millions of patients globally.|10.3030/101155955|Cluster Health

Despite aggressive therapy, about a third of patients have to give up work within 5 years of disease onset mainly due to lack of response to multiple disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), multi-drug resistance (MDR). Thus, the main objective of this proposal is to define the clinical and molecular phenotypes leading to MDR in RA patients to prevent when possible or, when not possible, optimise the management of these patients. MDR-RA is highly relevant to the program, as these patients are often disabled, unable to work and paying a high personal and societal burden. Moreover, MDR-RA is under-researched and the underlying pathobiological mechanisms for resistance remain unknown, while as we have no predictors of therapeutic response to any of currently available drugs, inevitably treatment is based on trial-and-error. MDR-RA has the ambition of transforming care for these patients and deliver significant advances beyond the state-of-the-art methodologies, as for the first time, molecular pathology will be integrated into clinical, psychosocial, pain perception and imaging profiling in existing clinical cohorts to develop truly holistic predictive models for future clinical use (iCare-RA). The transformative potential of iCare-RA will be tested in a prospective randomised trial in comparison with routine standard of care, while its future implementation potential will be assessed through an early economic modelling. Finally, a strong management and dissemination strategy will facilitate further advancing science in the field, beyond the duration of the project, and future adoption by patients, specialist professional bodies, policy makers and regulatory authorities.|10.3030/101155807|Cluster Health

An accurate diagnosis through genetic testing confirms the disorder in only about 50% of the cases. Different effective treatments to reduce cardiovascular disease exist; however these high-risk individuals are not being clinically identified. FH-EARLY will enable new strategies for earlier diagnosis and co-management of familial hypercholesterolemia facilitated by well-defined data flows, identifying new mechanisms through multiomics, explainable AI modelling and co-creation with families with FH and caregivers. Its specific objectives are:1.Use co-creation methods to involve FH patients, families and care teams during the project.2.Enhance 4 federated multi-modal datasets collated from established cohorts, and realworld datasets.3.Conduct large-scale functional characterization of FH-related gene variants, to illuminate affected protein function and the variability of the FH phenotype4.Develop and test an integrative precision health profiling methodology using explainable AI for FH risk prediction.5.Test and validate a new chip array for early diagnosis6.Establish clinical and health economic benefits for the signature biomarker in a multicenter interventional study for FH screening.7.Integrate the early signature biomarker into clinical practice to improve treatment selection and risk assessment of FH and severe hypercholesterolemia patients FH-EARLY will deliver a chip array for earlier, cheaper diagnosis, a signature biomarker assay for unique risk stratification and a XAI driven integrative precision health profiling tool. These will help reduce the burden of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, while shifting towards a holistic co-management approach including healthier living in families with FH.

This is perhaps unsurprising, as many tissues and organs continue to mature postnatally, often taking many years to attain the compositional and structural complexity that is integral to their function. A potential solution to this challenge is to engineer tissues that are more representative of an earlier stage of development, using bioprinting to not only generate such constructs, but to also provide them with guiding structures and biochemical cues that supports their maturation into fully functional tissues or organs within damaged or diseased in vivo environments. It has recently been demonstrated that such developmental processes are better recapitulated in ‘microtissues’ or ‘organoids formed from self-organizing (multi)cellular aggregates, motivating their use as biological building blocks for the engineering of larger scale tissues and organ. The main goal of micro2MACRO (m2M) is to develop a new bioprinting platform capable of spatially patterning numerous cellular aggregates or microtissues into scaled-up, personalised durable load-bearing grafts and guiding their (re)modelling into fully functional tissues in vivo within damaged or diseased environments. This will be achieved using a converged bioprinting approach capable of rapidly depositing cells and microtissues into guiding scaffold structures with high spatial resolution in a rapid, reliable, reproducible and quantifiable manner. These guiding structures will then function to direction the fusion and remodelling of cellular aggregates and microtissues into structurally organised tissues in vitro and in vivo, as well as providing medium-term (3-5 years) mechanical support to the regenerating tissue.|10.3030/101191729|Cluster Health

It targets a higher performing, cost optimized and more sustainable drivetrain layout that is also backwards compatible to the existing charging infrastructure with 1000V or 500V respectively.Determining exactly how high the new voltage level should be, to enable expected advantages in a systemic and systematic way is also part of the project. A new voltage level affects the entire sphere of electric mobility, both horizontally (vehicle, charging infrastructure, users, manufacturers) and vertically (OEM, tier1, tier2, single component supplier), hence a deliberate decision is required. To accomplish this an advanced electrical system architecture is presented by the ENLIGHTEN consortium in this proposal on whose basis a specific electric vehicle drivetrain will finally be developed and demonstrated in a C-segment vehicle. The at TRL5 delivered powertrain will consist of a dual voltage battery system and an integrated motor-inverter E-drive system, complemented by an intermediate DCDC converter, an AC and DC capable onboard charger and a power distribution. All power electronic devices will exploit low loss, ultra-fast switching gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors for highest efficiency and to minimize cooling demand and component size. The dual voltage battery can be switched dynamically from one battery voltage into the other while driving. Through these and other measures, the ENLIGHTEN system delivers significant advances over the 2024 State of the Art. The ENLIGHTEN consortium includes 2 automotive companies, 1 Tier1 supplier and 2 SMEs. Their expertise is leveraged by the partnership with 2 research institutions and 4 academia/universities, constituting an ideal setup for strengthening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry.|10.3030/101192573|Cluster 5

So far, wide-scale applicability of TE devices was limited by their low conversion efficiency, typically 5% at system level at the most. STARTREC will develop and evaluate a new generation of TEG based on the optimal combination of nanostructured Si85Ge15 thermoelectric materials with innovative device architectures designed by simulation:1) Three different materials processing routes using nanostructuration to increase material performances: Additive Manufacturing (AM); Nanostructured Rapid Casting (Nano-RC); Optimized Rapid Casting (O-RC); 2) Innovative device architectures, such as complex forms and cascade architectures, which can considerably improve both their performance and their optimal temperature ranges, and so increase their efficiencies and potential for wider applications.STARTREC aims at doubling TEG efficiencies up to 10% at system level (15% at device level). It will demonstrate their high-performances in relevant environments at TRL5 for three different and complementary high impact use cases (industrial, domestic and space). Technical work will be completed by dedicated life cycle studies to address economic and environmental issues for these TEGs. A strong dissemination and exploitation strategy and novel circular business models will allow the developed solution to open new application opportunities in other sectors. With TEGs produced and commercialized by European industrial leaders, reinforcing EU strategic autonomy in renewable energy technologies, STARTREC has a complete value-chain with two RTOs, two universities, one technological SME and three industrial end-users.STARTREC will serve a global TEG market valued at 447.1 million € in 2020 and forecasted to reach 1365.8 million € by 2030.|10.3030/101160663|Cluster 5

In the current energy transition, the building sector is recognized as a cornerstone due to the possibility to easily adopt advanced control strategies and smart management systems. Thereby cost-effectively increasing buildings’ energy efficiency and flexibility, while improving building users’ comfort, productivity, and health. This cost-effective energy use reduction will render faster implementation of on-site and nearby renewable energy sources, facilitate demand electrification, hence reducing Europe’s energy dependencies. Achieving the building sector energy transition demands an improvement of the interoperability of European buildings with energy carriers and non-energy services. Buildings must play an active role in ensuring the reliability, resilience, and sustainability of the energy system, particularly in the face of evolving challenges such as climate change, resource constraints, and other threats (e.g., cybersecurity, geopolitical, etc.). Therefore, the aim of ENTRANCE is to enable smart-grid-ready and decarbonized buildings through the integration of energy efficiency, flexibility, on-site renewables, mobility, empowerment of end-users, and interoperability between buildings and district heating and electricity grids. The ambition of ENTRANCE is to develop and demonstrate solutions that promote building integration and active participation in the energy system and market through guaranteeing end-users’ comfort and empowerment while creating value for the economic actors of the energy landscape.

The conversion of microwave electromagnetic radiation to heat relies on a high dielectric loss tangent (DLT). This is of importance as many of Europe’s most energy intensive industries utilise low dielectric loss raw materials. Carbon fibre (CF) which is used to produce carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP), is produced from poly(acrylonitrile) (PAN) which exhibits a low DLT (0.007). CF is designated as a strategic material for Europe as it is deployed in many crucial sectors which underpin Europe’s future energy security e.g. in manufacture of light weight wind turbines for wind energy generation; in manufacture of light weight automobiles and electric vehicles for a more energy efficient Transport sector; and similarly for a more energy efficient Construction sector. Hence, CARBOWAVE will have vast economic and environmental impact. Europe dominates the advanced carbon materials market supplying 37% of the global market, which is projected to grow at a CAGR of 5.8% to reach US$7.9 billion by 2027. Currently, the industry uses large amounts of electricity and natural gas to generate the heat necessary for conversion of PAN to CF (100–900 MJ per one kg of CF produced), limiting the industrial use of CF to high end and expensive applications. In this context, CARBOWAVE aims to drastically reduce the energy consumption, carbon emissions and production cost of CFs. This in-turn will radically transform the construction, wind energy and EV industries. CARBOWAVE will achieve this through development of two alternative heating sources; an atmospheric plasma for stabilisation of PF, and a radically new susceptor induced microwave heating technology specifically designed for increasing microwave absorption, allowing the conversion of stabilised PF to CF in a continuous production process at TRL 6.|10.3030/101192581|Cluster 5

To this end, LBUS will create a CHAIR position for Professor Lavinia STAN from St. Francis Xavier University (Canada), whose outstanding academic profile and thorough expertise in the cross-cutting fields of government, religion, economics and epistemology that foster (de)colonial feminist thinking (Lugones, 2010; Manning, 2021) and the institutionalisation of Gender Studies in Romania (Turcescu and Stan, 2005; Stan, 2010) will help increase the number of excellent research staff and improve their capability to attract competitive research funding with significant spill-over effects at societal level, while also assisting LBUS to implement institutional reforms that both align with ERA priorities and facilitate the implementation of the Gender Equality Plan (GEP). The main objective of this FERBOPO is to create a ‘pocket of excellence’ in LBUS by attracting outstanding scientists with internationally mobile academic careers so as to improve the host institution’s organizational culture and the academic outputs of LBUS scholars. Romanian higher education institutions continue to lag behind their Western counterparts in their governance effectiveness and academic performance indicators (Dobbins, 2017). An acute scientific production deficit is related to Gender Studies (Vlase and Terian, 2023). By creating the new chair and research group, the proposed ERA Chair will help LBUS to near European standards of academic performance and institutionalisation of Gender Studies. Through the employment at LBUS of the ERA Chair holder, FERBOPO will contribute to the creation of a knowledge hub in the university, in particular, and the Romanian higher education system, in general.|10.3030/101184092|Other

Antithyroid medications can cause severe side effects, underscoring the need for careful management of thyroid diseases to avoid increased healthcare costs and lost productivity. Current treatment approaches, often not personalized, overlook genetic predispositions and environmental factors. Advances in genomics, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and the polygenic risk score (PRS), offer new opportunities for personalized medicine. These tools, combined with electronic health records (EHR) and lifestyle data, can improve disease prediction and prevention strategies. Pharmacogenomics further enables tailored drug treatment based on individual genetic profiles, promising more effective and personalized care. The design of thyroid disease gene panels and the development of innovative and digital solutions based on artificial intelligence stand as pivotal advancements. These could markedly accelerate the integration of more personalized and cost-effective approaches into clinical practice, heralding a new era of precision medicine for thyroid disorders.|10.3030/101187880|Other

Nevertheless, many policies and initiatives fail to effectively support them and/or engage the more vulnerable groups of population. The main objective of ESIRA is to contribute to the rollout of place-based innovative social economy initiatives for rural inclusion and development in (marginalised) rural areas by supporting enabling frameworks, well-interconnected policy architecture and directly piloting innovative solutions which ultimately build more inclusive, resilient and prosperous rural areas. To achieve it, ESIRA will implement a work plan focused on (i) the research of community-led rural innovation spaces able to connect and empower actors, reinforce the social capital and sense of community, considering the great diversity of rural areas within Europe, and eventually (ii) nurturing and piloting social economy initiatives that strengthen the inclusiveness and living conditions of different groups of population in vulnerable situation, from the improvement in the provision of (social) services, economic diversification, and sustainable management of the natural capital. This will enable to (iii) stocktake and formulate recommendations for policymakers to better support the third sector and local communities, increasing the understanding of the needs and challenges of vulnerable groups of population and social economy, and (iv) boost the knowledge-exchange among local actors, building up their capacities and facilitating the scale up and replication of social economy initiatives across Rural Europe. 9 regions in 7 European countries will be involved in the project.

For that purpose, the EU and its Member States deployed a mix of different instruments aiming at responsible sourcing and supply chain DD. These instruments cover a variety of requirements both horizontal (proposed upcoming Critical Raw Materials Act and Directive for Corporate Due Diligence and Corporate Accountability) and product or commodity specific levels (i.e. Conflict Minerals Regulation, Battery Regulation). These diverse frameworks of legal requirements for DD processes set and enforce standards for business, regulate markets, and, ultimately, foster a level playing field – i.e. a state in which conditions in a competition or situation are fair for everyone. Even though front runner companies, policy and civil society call for mandatory DD, the majority of EU based companies are currently struggling to implement DD: Only one third of larger EU companies practices voluntary DD covering human rights and the environment, while only one in seven companies claim to cover the entire value chain. The DiliCHANCE Project aims to fundamentally reshape the current DD operational system: Looking into DD solutions from a holistic three-pronged approach - tools, business practice, and assurance & verification - assessing their efficacy and engaging in capacity building with key decision-makers from business and policy, as well as civil society will unlock industrial leadership for key EU mineral value chains.|10.3030/101177460|Cluster 4

The methodology includes intelligent coupling of interconnected processing steps by numerical simulation, soft sensors, process data and distributed machine learning. Integrated numerical modelling that captures the interactions, relations, and feedback loops between various processing stations enables prediction for smart optimization of energy efficiency and product quality in the steel manufacturing. Continuous casting, reheating, hot metal working, quenching and leveling processes are examples that are controlled separately but strongly interconnected in terms of parameters. These processes serve as objective functions in two parallel use cases at Celsa (ES) and SSAB (SW). It is well known that process optimization can have a significant effect on reducing carbon footprint in steel production, and implementing new digital tools will enable a faster transition towards sustainable industry. ProcTwin is divided in clear work packages to reach the objectives: one is adaption of existing physically based numerical models of each process step to generate critical data that is impossible to measure or observe. Another is development of novel sensors and data integration for a secure and effective sharing industrial data. The innovative concept of ProcTwin is development of distributed machine learning to predict the process chains with large amounts of parameters.

Current image-guided surgery techniques face limitations in resolution and real-time imaging, posing challenges for completely excising tumors while preserving healthy tissue. Fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy offers superior depth resolution by measuring the time a fluorophore spends in the excited state before emitting a photon. This technique minimizes errors from environmental factors and photon scattering in tissue but suffers from limited penetration depth. Superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) present a solution due to their high performance in longer wavelengths, enabling greater penetration depth. However, current SNSPDs require substantial cooling and are bulky, making them unsuitable for clinical settings. The aim is to develop a portable quantum sensor based on SNSPDs, integrated into a time-resolved fluorescence imaging microscope for use in operating rooms. The prototype will feature a compact cryogenic system for cooling, optimized detectors for efficiency and speed, and software for image analysis. Made of EU components, the system aims for medical-grade quality, enabling real-time analysis of tumor and healthy tissues during surgery, ultimately improving patient outcomes.|10.3030/101189824|Cluster 4

At the moment, most EO based crop monitoring tools are based on optical satellite inputs. In areas with substantial cloud cover the use of these applications is extremely limited. To be able to introduce more sustainable crop management practices, reliable and continuous time series on crop phenology and health throughout the growing season are needed. This will support farmers to match agricultural inputs (fertilisers, pesticides, water) with what the crop actually needs, decreasing their environmental footprint. DINOSAR will  do this by integrating the diagnostic power of optical, infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals. With the DINOSAR project we intend to kickstart a revolution in EO-based solutions that tackle challenges in agriculture (under clouds) by making full use of the Copernicus infrastructure. We intend to take the existing methodology a step further by designing a multi-sensor operational monitoring method for a single crop (sugarcane) capable of operating on large data volumes, and then extrapolating this approach to practical field cases and to other crops (and geographies) for which the application of EO-based applications has been underexplored. Rather than looking at optical and SAR based data as two parallel signals, we will focus on integrating the two early on in the processing chain. This has not been done before. Sugarcane in Colombia is our initial test-case, but we will not stop there. DINOSAR will also develop a methodology integrating the combined observations from optical, infrared and SAR EO satellites to monitor other crops in other geographies.|10.3030/101129646|Other

The vision of the project is to extend the use of Copernicus Earth observation data for the application of climate-smart agriculture in Africa to regional research and innovation development. To enhance the use of Copernicus data by local African stakeholders, we have proposed several practical but innovative approaches. First of all, Copernicus data should be integrated into the local IoT dataset to enhance the local context, users and market needs of the application. Therefore, the project proposed to develop a Space-IoT Solution Box (called KijaniBox, GreenBox in Swahili ) that integrates the existing platform, tools and dataset for simplified local availability and accessibility. Using the KijaniBox EO and IoT resources, the project will launch two programs, one called Training Program for skills development and creation of minimum viable products and another Innovation Program for SMS innovation experiments.  In addition, the project will conduct the pilot demonstration of two agricultural applications (crop farming and fish farming). Finally, the project will engage the various local and international stakeholders and actors with a multi-stakeholder approach to co-create innovation and collaboration environments.  KijaniBox is a highly innovation-oriented consortium composed of thirteen (13) companies, six European and seven African partners from seven (7) different countries. The concept of the KijaniSpace project is being piloted in the Great Lake Victoria basin region. The ultimate aim of KijaniSpace is to pave the way for long-term sustainable economic growth and green job creation in Africa and Europe through Copernius and IoT.|10.3030/101180225|Other

These are expected to be safer, quieter, greener, and less expensive to operate and maintain than existing vertical takeoff and landing aircraft. They promise to be much less complex than legacy helicopters (of comparable size and carrying capability), but the reduced complexity of the aeronautical structure does not imply simpler avionics for flight control, navigation, and vehicle management, which will have to address an integration problem. This touches diverse Position Navigation and Time (PNT) technologies and the low-level data fusion between Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) and Inertial Navigation Systems (INS) is a solution, especially if new features of GNSS signals are exploited. GAUSSIAN addresses the problem of safety and security of UAM applications that rely on PNT modules powered by EGNSS. Specifically, GAUSSIAN wants to demonstrate the value of the authenticated Galileo E1 signals combined to integrated GNSS/INS platforms to have (i) greater robustness against spoofing attempts and (ii) better continuity and availability of PNT data in constrained environments. GAUSSIAN wants to mitigate some security risks and concerns which originate from real needs of flight operators, leveraging advances in existing PNT technologies. The project also includes the application of the Precise Point Positioning (PPP)-RTK corrections provided by the Galileo High Accuracy Service (HAS) to improve the PNT data accuracy. GAUSSIAN starts from existing concepts, prototypes and components developed by the proposing companies, with a strong focus on the creation of new integrated and certified products for the upcoming air mobility market.|10.3030/101129480|Other

Mining activities generate residues such as rock wastes, tailings and stockpiles. These materials are associated with environmental and safety risks that need to be carefully managed throughout their life cycle, with an emphasis on stability and the prevention of water and soil pollution. Earth-observation (EO)-based techniques are seldom used for monitoring these deposits, and multi-sensor field data is commonly not integrated despite recent technological advances. MOSMIN will develop holistic, full-site services for the geotechnical and environmental monitoring as well as valorisation of mining-related deposits based on a combination of EO and in situ geophysical data. We will use Copernicus EO data for large-scale monitoring of ground deformation and surface composition. Innovative change detection algorithms will highlight displacements and identify environmental hazards. Satellite data will be integrated with real-time, high-resolution data obtained from unoccupied aerial vehicles and sensors installed at the site, leveraging the power of machine learning for fusion and resolution enhancement of multi-scale, multi-source data. Novel, non-invasive geophysical techniques such as distributed fibre-optic sensing will provide subsurface information to identify resource potential, and risks such as internal deformation and seepage. In collaboration with international mining companies, MOSMIN will use pilot sites in the EU, South America, and Africa to develop and trial comprehensive monitoring services, which are calculated to have a Total Available Market of €1.2bn and expect to be commercialised shortly after project completion by three industry partners.

Coastal “Blue carbon” ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and storage, biodiversity and coastal protection. Despite their socio-economic and biological importance, they face numerous threats from human activities and climate change, necessitating their conservation and management. Mapping, modelling and monitoring coastal zones using Earth Observation (EO) data is essential for this task. It needs to consider the complex coastal dynamics, past and future change scenarios, and the interaction between Blue Carbon and the coastal zone dynamics. By integrating EO data, advanced modelling techniques, and detailed process-based morphodynamic models, COASTS aims to develop a downstream service for coastal observation, with a focus on Blue Carbon. This service, utilizing Copernicus Marine and other initiatives, will provide govern. stakeholders and coastal planning with relevant information for developing coastal management strategies, including the assessment of blue carbon habitats and their environmental services. Further, COASTS will develop innovative methods and comprehensive analyses to create new business models related to emergent blue carbon markets and will offer new international income sources for countries with blue carbon ecosystem presence. COASTS will initially focus on pilot sites in Germany, Jersey, and the Maldives where govern. customers have a demand and support the project. The learnings from these examples will form a blueprint for broader application in other regions in response to a growing global need.

In the last year, Russia’s strategic use of FIMI in its war of aggression against Ukraine has brought an unprecedented response by those defenders who seek to safeguard universal values, democracy, and freedoms by exposing Russia’s efforts to manipulate global discourses. While governance, law, protocols, data exchange, and forensic practices should converge to address FIMI, they currently remain disparate and unaligned. This fragmented approach creates a significant hurdle in the fight against FIMI, hindering the ability of member states to prosecute, ban, attribute, or sanction FIMI actors or campaigns originating from state and non-state actors. To overcome this hurdle there is a need to better synchronise the interventions and harmonise our approach towards FIMI, as proven in the case of cyberattacks. Our consortium, SAUFEX (Secure Automated Unified Framework for Exchange), comprises of concerned stakeholders who possess significant expertise and hands-on experience with the current systems and structures concerning FIMI and are situated in the EU's Eastern regions, where FIMI incidents are frequently observed. We strongly understand the importance of consolidating and utilising available information to establish a collective comprehension of FIMI. To achieve this, our project proposes the creation of a FIMI data-space, which we will herby refer to as a FIMI knowledge database, as well as the establishment of a Resilience Council to act as an intermediary between state and non-state actors, specifically regarding interventions and FIMI attribution.|10.3030/101132494|Cluster 2

The intention is to form an umbrella across the value chain, which allows to jointly define and push the boundaries of the most sustainable cellulosic filament currently available on a “pre-industrial” scale – Lyocell filament. As the starting point is at a TRL5 (pilot) with key drivers and innovators being within the industry (not in basic research), the actual amount of relevant scientific (as in basic research) publications is rare. Lyocell filament has been introduced to the market in small volumes in 2017, but the development of the value chain and the overall market acceptance is still at an early stage. Lyocell filament has the potential to achieve this: continuous-filament yarns (or filament yarns) are smooth to touch, lacking the bulk of staple fiber yarns and can be used to produce a wide range of woven and knitted fabrics for various textiles and clothing. The global filament market exceeds the global staple fiber market, but is still vastly dominated by fossil-based, non-recyclable materials (foremost PET and Polyamide). No significant innovations have been introduced on an industrial scale in decades, however the environmentally friendly, closed-loop lyocell process has been established already in the early 2000s. A European-based global innovator has developed a Lyocell filament (LF) process to a state to improve both commercialization and sustainability with a consortium of key partners along the value chain. The proposed innovation project aims to catalyze further development and validation of key production processes along the value chain; to define business models and plans to enable market uptake within 1–2 years post-project i.e. by 2030.|10.3030/101135042|Cluster 6

Munich, Copenhagen, Scotland and Lisbon will prepare investment-ready circular construction hubs (CCH) and showcase how they transform local and regional markets for secondary building components and materials. CCH cover physical material banks and digital infrastructure to provide the resource basis for the EU Taxonomy requirements for construction. To date, CCH have not successfully scaled-up across Europe. The project will demonstrate that CCHs can become bankable projects at scale and provide lucrative investment opportunities for financiers. The showcases develop sound technical, business, and financial plans of more than 80 M€ total investment volume.CIRCOFIN streamlines a common project development assistance (PDA) methodology for CCH, used and validated by the showcases. The methodology results in a CCH Toolbox, which consists of customizable components for all project development stages, from pre-feasibility to due diligence and bankability appraisal. It covers all elements of CCH – physical design, digital infrastructure, logistics, business models, operation models and financial models. The results will be published as a CCH Cookbook with concrete facts and figures, ready for widespread replication by other cities and regions. Replication and roll-out aim to trigger uptake in 30 other cities and regions from the CCRI, Circular Cities Declaration and the Mission Cities of the 100 Climate-neutral and Smart Cities Mission. Investors and EU financial initiatives will gain expertise in advising CCH projects via robust technical and operational insights and learn how to review associated risks, to make better investment decisions on circular economy projects. Standardization will on CEN and ISO as well as policy recommendations improve regulation to enable business and investment cases for CCH market uptake in Europe.|10.3030/101180525|Cluster 6

The twin transition stands at the heart of the Green Deal and Farm to Fork strategy. The agri-food sector plays a critical role in the realisation of these ambitions. The nature of deep tech innovation also shows the need for a transition via responsible regulatory frameworks. Living Labs are looking for more experimentation by engaging societal stakeholders and addressing innovation barriers experienced by agri-food companies. SIXFOLD aims to facilitate implementation of deep tech within the agri-food sector, by building a robust network of Living Labs across the EU. This network will support a dynamic and regionally embedded ecosystem thriving with deep tech innovations relevant for the agri-food industry such as AI and machine learning, robots and co-bots, biotech, etc. throughout the food system. The timing is critical for agri-food companies to experiment with innovative technologies and collaboration with deep tech innovators. SIXFOLD builds on an existing framework. Nevertheless, a careful assessment of the current state of play through interviews and study visits is made after which assessed barriers to innovation is tackled by a tailor-made co-creation process. This ensures maximum participation of external experts, regulators, and broader societal actors on regional and European levels and in turn generates a more complete and validated Action Plan adapted to real-world needs. The network of Living Labs will in this way facilitate collaborative knowledge exchange by actively engaging stakeholders from various regions and ensuring inclusivity and diversity in participation. Amongst other objectives, the updated Operational Handbook of the network of Living Labs will form the basis of a successful transition towards sustainable food systems across Europe.|10.3030/101158281|Other

This gap results in an insuperable obstacle for emerging startups that have no tools and occasions to scale up and develop their businesses. Lacking this, Europe is missing the chance to brighten up the overall enterprise system as thousands of brilliant ideas don’t generate positive spillovers. To tackle this issue, SMAFINE goal is to create a strong ecosystem based on three main pillars:1. Support local stakeholders - SMAFINE will implement activities of capacity building for local stakeholder, supporting the connection between innovation stakeholders and foreign investors; 2. Support foreign stakeholders - Foster the bond between foreign and local stakeholders through well-defined activities; 3. Co-creation with policy makers at local level and at 'modest' or 'moderate' innovator regions level.

It modernises public services and accelerates the market entry of innovations. However, Europe has not fully tapped into its potential due to barriers.Small innovative companies should be more interested in IPs but face challenges engaging with public procurers (PPs). This is due to a) lack of awareness about public contracts and b) distrust in the procurement process. Startups find it difficult to meet the requirements and adapt to lengthy procurement procedures, leading many to avoid them.The barriers faced by public procurers when working with startups:•Qualitative selection procedures often favour large cooperations in PP, and there is little understanding of startup accreditation mechanisms.•Evaluating startups requires precise adjustments to criteria related to technical solvency, economic performance, and autonomy.•Establishing testing environments like regulatory sandboxes and granting temporary testing licenses for startups.•Understanding acceptable payment options and liquidity needs specific to startups in procurement processes.The ECLIPSE project will design and test a new cutting-edge interaction model to connect PP and innovative suppliers with investor ecosystems. Special attention will be dedicated to the role of venture capitalists and how they can effectively contribute to the IP process and foster the market exploitation of its results.

SEACLIM will also advance the understanding of physical and ecosystem processes to further develop regional ocean models. New regional ocean indicators will be developed to assess the ocean state and health over coming decades. SEACLIM R&I will be performed over three European seas: the northeastern Atlantic, northwest shelf including the North Sea and the Arctic Ocean, but will be replicable to other regional seas.

However, farms face large societal pressures related to soil: cleaner water, healthier soils, improved carbon storage and increase in biodiversity. A better understanding of the variability of soil properties and quality is needed, with current market solutions being too expensive and not well suited to farmer needs.SQAT's smart soil mapping service is a multi-level, multi-technology and multi-purpose solution. With a keen eye on markets and users, SQAT’s approach is designed to overcome today’s practical, technical and financial challenges to generate high resolution soil properties maps – and demand-driven products like application maps for soil improvement or crop management, or compliancy proof for eco schemes. Our vision is that the integration of different technologies provides a flexible and agile service beating the unbundled alternatives that are now in the market: our in-situ sampling and/or sensoring is wrapped in a Copernicus-based artificial intelligence soil mapping product.In the field, our autonomous robot-mounted sensor toolbox includes VIS-NIR sensors, automated sampler drill and penetrometer, and a novel chamber for in situ wet chemical soil analysis (Lab in the Field). Overall, the system increases the productivity and reduces laboratory/labour costs compared to current approaches. Using resulting maps, SQAT co-develops, tests and validates 5 smart farming applications to deliver value to farmers: Variable rate liming/fertilisation/seeding, Variable depth tillage, & Carbon farming MRV.We include 7 SMEs from across the SQAT data value chain to lead co-development in 7 use cases across Europe. The results will be commercialised by project end courtesy of a pro-active market focus, that aims to engage and onboard users in the use case locations, as well as other agri-service providers to develop their own SQAT-enabled smart farming applicatications.|10.3030/101129644|Other

The growing use of commercial components (COTS), notably for the expanding market sector of constellations, means that European Space Industry is already using large amount of components with lead-free finishes even when the equivalent leaded high-reliable version is available. Even though the Space Sector is exempted from RoHS restrictions (Restriction on the use of certain Hazardous Substances), market pressure may also result on potential future difficult availability of leaded solder paste. This project addresses the main challenges of the Pb-free transition for the European Space Sector that were described in the Roadmap delivered in 2020 by the ESCC Task Force created to that end. First, we will study the obstacles that hinder today the wider use of COTS components in space projects using existing qualified assembly processes based on leaded solders. Second, we will launch a comprehensive evaluation of two lead-free solders that show promise for the Space Sector including reliability model development. Sn-solders were alloyed with lead at the beginning of the electronics era mainly to inhibit the growth of whiskers, therefore going to lead-free electronics creates a serious risk for space projects that may result in catastrophic failure in the satellite due to whiskers growth. The Space sector has developed mitigation approaches but the real challenge is to obtain accelerated tests that will give confidence that, for a given mitigation used and for the duration of the project, the risk is managed and acceptable. For that we propose to perform basic research to advance the state-of-the-art on our knowledge of whisker growth, leading to the determination of the pertinent activation energies that can be used in the design of accelerated tests. |10.3030/101135428|Cluster 4

Therefore, it is evident that there is a need to allow the satellite operators to manage GOVSATCOM users efficiently with the overall available resources. This project aims to evolve the flagship European initiative “GOVSATCOM-HUB” to improve the flexibility of satellite network operators in allocating their resources to the needs of GOVSATCOM users. This goal will require the development of a new interface between the G-HUB and the 5G core network entities and microservice-based services interacting among them to provide network management tasks. Moreover, the 5G-HUB project will address the interoperability issues, allowing the GOVSATCOM user terminal to connect to different space assets, eventually including terrestrial systems. This project aims to validate the G-HUB functions in three trials with the initial development of a unified 5G NTN terminal in Ku and X bands. The trials will aim to verify the system performance in terms of resource allocation, quality of service provision, and capacity to switch communication (traffic steering) from the satellite network to the terrestrial network in a way that is unnoticeable to the user. These trials will be based on critical scenarios of emergency management where there is the need to coordinate teams in remote areas where satellite systems mainly provide connectivity.

The aim of this proposal is to integrate immersive media technologies such as point cloud/holographic imaging, multi-sensorial media, Social VR in a multi-user, feedback-enabled communication system to provide the construction of compelling context-aware and embodied experiences for innovative hybrid XR applications, where remote users can experience a real captured environment through immersive VR, while in presence users can visualise and interact with the holograms of remote users integrated in the real environment through holographic rendering.The system will aim at facilitating the exploitation of agile (multi-sensory) 3D data acquisition techniques, enhancing performance while reducing technology costs. It will create a scalable communication pipeline embodying either encapsulation of different media from classical audio-video to multisensorial to holographic video or a combination of them, providing means for efficient and scalable encoding, processing, storage, (real-time) streaming and rendering. In such a way, the system will allow users to provide/exploit the features according to the acquisition/rendering system available.The project will provide well designed and fully tested scenarios in real-world environments for enhanced XR experiences: a blended learning, a modern theatre act, a music festival and an opera show. All pilot actions will ensure that GDPR and ethics are addressed for end-users (privacy and ethics by design methodology).|10.3030/101135637|Cluster 4

However, there are persistent problems with the recycling of such materials. The TOSCA project thus aims at the development of a processing chain for new epoxy vitrimer resins, which have the mechanical performance of conventional thermoset resins, but allow the more efficient recycling. This type of resin is already taking the first steps towards certification and there is a need to develop the related production processes.The TOSCA project will investigate a whole processing chain, including lay-up by automated fibre placement, curing, re-work, maintenance and repair. This processing chain will be supported by digital tools to acquire data through integrated inspection systems and through sensors for structural health monitoring, that are embedded in critical areas of the part. All these data will be used to iteratively improve production, aiming at a zero-defect manufacturing process.The consortium consists of research partners and industry covering all the processing steps. All of the research organisations are linked to industrial partners to ensure a proper take-up of the results by industry after the end of the project. About 2000 companies including OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers in Europe in the field of composite parts manufacturing (mainly structural parts) as well as machine building companies will benefit from the results. Interaction with Clean Aviation has taken place and will continue in TOSCA to ensure that the developments fit into the long-term roadmaps of the European aviation industry.|10.3030/101191394|Cluster 5

Nowadays, containerships are built with the same basic design principles as the older smaller container ships, without accounting for possible consequences that could impact safety. Cargo fires represents one of the most important threats of this kind of ships (also for ferries with container on the truck). On one hand, fire causes large losses of humans and/or cargoes, on the other hand fire is impacting coastal zone and marine protected areas. Currently, there are no requirements for the installation of fixed fire detection systems above the weather deck of a container ship. Innovative strategies for containership fires prevention and management (OVERHEAT) main goal is to prevent and manage, in case of occurrence fire accidents on board of containerships. OVERHEAT brings novel fire management solutions for Prevention, Early Detection and Response which are key aspects to assure safety of people and the protection of the environment. The development of a Digital Solution (DS) will provide the overall situational picture on board and surrounding the vessel. Furthermore, integration of IoT sensors (fixed and mobile) and UAS will provide the ad-hoc system for the prevention, early detection and rapid response of fire. Best practice and assessment of safety culture will be conducted to prevent fire and understand how people perceive safety. Hence, OVERHEAT prepares a truly new generation of digital fire management solutions: complete, seamless, real time and in line with IMO regulations (integrated in the vessel IT infrastructure). The impact of the proposed solution will be initially evaluated by performing validation activities in simulated environment and then executing demonstration activities in a real environment, with use cases that will be identified, described and detailed during the research activities, to prove the feasibility and benefits.|10.3030/101076633|Cluster 5

For decarbonization of the sector, several new fuels, ranging from hydrogen via ammonia to synthetic eFuels are considered. An import question is how these potential new fuels will influence the emission of air toxicants and other environment- and climate-active compounds. LowC will address if these new fuels for high-power engines have an impact on the emissions of air pollutants and climate-drivers, considering also upstream emissions and secondary pollutants formed under different atmospheric conditions (daytime photochemical aging or night-time atmospheric radical chemistry). LowC will apply a series of state-of-the-art technologies and models. This includes a unique Engine Emission Facility equipped for testing of all currently considered low- or zero-carbon fuels with real ship, aircraft and land-based heavy-duty engines, oxidation flow reactors for atmospheric simulation, novel real-time in-situ exhaust characterization approaches, cutting-edge technologies for offline analysis of collected samples and advanced online air-liquid-interface (ALI) exposure systems for in vitro testing of biological effects in lung tissue models. The toxicological testing will be applied in a tiered manner (screening and in-depth verification), in line with visions of Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century. Emission data, including regulated and emerging pollutants, will feed into pollution emission and atmospheric transport models currently used to underpin EU policy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan. Finally, LowC will evaluate health and environmental impacts and provide guidance and recommendations to ensure that solutions to reduce CO2-emissions and prevent climate change are safe and sustainable.|10.3030/101192913|Cluster 5

The progression of these production processes will imply changes in the composition and management of generated by-products, especially for those containing Zn. Likewise, the large rate of fossil fuels/reductants needed in the current valorisation processes of these wastes make them very intensive in terms of CO2 emissions, requiring the metallurgical industry to move to H2 applications in its targeted pathway towards zero wastes goal. To tackle with these complex challenges and to solve the recycling of key steelmaking by-products like EAF dust, BOF dust and sludges, DR sludge and pellet fines and mill scales (among others), ZHYRON will develop an innovative valorisation route for Fe-rich and Zn-containing by-products based on the combination of pyrometallurgical (using green H2 as reductant) and hydrometallurgical stages The iron oxides units would be recovered as Direct Reduced Iron able to be consumed in EAF and the zinc would be recovered as zinc oxide concentrate to be used in zinc smelting sector, contributing thus to circular economy and industrial symbiosis approaches.The proposed technologies will be developed and endorsed at lab pilot scale (TRL6), and the obtained circular products will be validated by testing and characterization analysis. ZHYRON will also examine solutions regarding technical integration, economic and environmental criteria, contributing to the development of novel business models, guidelines and strategies. ZHYRON has been structured in 6 WP, combining R&D activities, project management and dissemination activities, and gathering a competitive consortium of 9 partners from 6 EU countries. If the solutions are successful, the benefits will include avoiding landfill of dangerous wastes, reduction in the CO2 emissions and the implementation of a new circular economy loop.|10.3030/101138276|Cluster 4

However, the use of synthetic composites made from carbon or glass fibre has several difficulties in terms recycling and in terms of dependence on third countries. About 98% of these synthetic composites still end up in landfills and about 80% of the raw materials are currently manufactured outside of Europe. To improve this situation, the project addresses the challenges of using bio-composites for structural parts and aims to increase the range of applications in which bio-composites can be used. This will be achieved by developing an accurate draping process to control fibre orientation, by creating material models that capture the natural variability of the material and by integrating nano-structured, bio-based sensors for load monitoring. Through the increased accuracy and additional control loops in the manufacturing process the consortium expects to achieve predictable properties and constant quality.Within the project use cases from wind energy and boat-building will be investigated, aiming at the manufacturing of a full size rotor blade and a ship hull to demonstrate the technical feasibility and achieving TRL7 for the manufacturing technologies. In addition to the end users, the consortium consists of partners from automation, machine building, measurement technology, material manufacturing and simulation software to cover all aspects of the developments. Based on the predicted growth of the bio-composites market, which is expected to increase by a factor of 2.5 by 2030, the consortium expects a market potential of about 100M€ by 2030.|10.3030/101136335|Cluster 4

Despite this, EU manufacturers are struggling to innovate, with traditional tools presenting a major bottleneck.Existing machining tools were designed for a more stable world, when a single process flow would remain unchanged for years. To increase competitiveness and respond to new opportunities, the manufacturing industry now needs customisable tools, applicable to multiple processes, and rapidly reconfigurable in response to changing needs.FLASH is an industry driven project, led by global manufacturing leader PRIMA and supported by 6 large enterprises, 6 innovative SMEs, 2 Universities, 2 RTOs, and a manufacturing association, EWF, that represents >55k companies globally.FLASH will leverage the benefits of laser-based manufacturing, which is more flexible, more amenable to digital control, and generates less waste than traditional mechanical/chemical/thermal processes. Whilst state of the art laser-based machines are optimised for a single application, FLASH will develop a flexible platform with three built-in laser sources, allowing multi-wavelength emission, over a broad pulse length regime with dynamic beam shaping, in a flexible robotic/CNC cell with three different beam delivery heads.The result will be a futureproof system capable of at least 10 macro and micro production processes over all major material types, designed to enable flexible and customisable manufacturing of rapidly evolving products for a range of industries.The benefits of FLASH will be industrially demonstrated in the automotive (car cross beam), medical (hip implant), e-mobility (electric motor hairpins) and tooling (micro drills, super abrasive grinding wheels) industries, where significant process-time, -cost and -energy savings are expected, alongside unlocking product benefits through design modifications and material substitutions not possible using existing technologies.|10.3030/101138380|Cluster 4

It aims to bridge the versatile benefits of plant-based proteins with the functional and organoleptic (taste, aroma, texture) advantages of mycelial protein biomass (MPB) and develop innovative minimally processed hybrid meat analogues that are both healthy, and tasty. The project promotes sustainability by upcycling underutilized circular substrates such as starch rich pea protein by-product, and brewers spent grains to produce MPB by submerged fermentation (SmF) and solid-state fermentation (SSF), respectively. Envisioning a near-zero waste process design, PLANTOMYC proposes converting the broth from SmF into a Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) enriched beverage and / or a flavorful bouillon. Adopting a multi-actor approach, the project addresses challenges related to consumer preferences, technological scaling, and regulatory requirements. Notably, the impact of PLANTOMYC’s product prototypes on nutritional, functional (gut health & metabolic syndrome), techno-functional, and sensory properties will be assessed thoroughly. Moreover, to advance PLANTOMYC’s TRL, we perform a comprehensive impact assessment for the adoption of these products, utilizing our consortium’s industrial end-users. PLANTOMYC will significantly increase the competitiveness of European alternative protein initiatives. It will accelerate the sector by offering an open-access knowledge platform, introducing new production concepts for hybrid meat analogues, increasing resource independence and efficiency, providing new market opportunities for industrial partners like Millow, BRØL, and Lantmännen, increasing the affordability of alternative proteins, and reducing the environmental footprint of protein production|10.3030/101181982|Cluster 6

YOUROPE addresses the traditionally low political participation rates among, especially underrepresented, youth by tapping into their potential and aspirations through innovative approaches. YOUROPE aspires to transform European citizenship and democracy by enhancing youth involvement, creating a more inclusive democratic process, and developing policies that align with the different needs, perspectives, and ambitions of European youth, especially those who are currently underrepresented. YOUROPE is dedicated to reinvigorating European democracy by enhancing inclusivity and participation, particularly focusing on underrepresented youth and their communities. This is achieved by establishing shared democratic spaces and roadmaps through the innovative 'Community-Led Research and Action (CLRA)' methodology in combination with quantitative methods. This democratic methodology promotes a reciprocal environment of learning and action within educational institutions, recognizing their significant role in advancing European citizenship and democracy. It also ensures that strategies are grounded in evidence, sustainable, iterative, extensive in scale, and fundamentally participatory. Educational institutions are pivotal in this effort, acting as catalysts for democratic engagement. In these settings, young individuals and their communities will collaboratively develop inclusive, participatory democratic spaces and roadmaps. YOUROPE will implement this approach in 21 educational institutions, involving 630 young individuals and 6300 community members, connecting them directly with over 30 European policymakers.

Moreover, the demand is increasing to log the outputs of those machines for analysis, documentation and compliance. However, current datafiles sent to, or retrieved from machinery lack quality standards. They cannot be certified because any guarantee on the integrity of the used data and workflow is missing. HASHTAG is therefore leveraging space assets and services to safeguard the reliability of data ensuring trusted application and governance. Within a period of two years, three building blocks will be developed to proof our concept: 1. Standardising protocols, logging and verifying prescribed tasks using machine data flows to assure as-applied maps are trustworthy.2. Standardising the processing of high quality EO data from Copernicus into prescription maps.3. Using Galileo’s High Accuracy Service and Navigation Message Authenticator in a GNSS receiver to provide trusted and accurate machine positioning. Integrating these components will result in a workflow capable of generating a transparant and authenticated data chain of EO data to as-applied maps. This is relevant for current reality, where food production and processing are international businesses with ingredients from around the world, governed by food standards and environmental regulations. Our solution, deploying space assets, can be used anywhere in the world, hence leveraging European knowledge and expertise to enable the next level of sustainable and regenerative farming. International partners from Serbia are included and use cases in Brazil, Ukraine and Indonesia will be explored. HASHTAG will reach out to standardisation initiatives in agritech to promote its results and increase impacts.

The EU is currently struggling with soil degradation which is undoubtedly linked to agriculture intensification. Thus, a new soil management paradigm on soil monitoring, restoration and protection must be an endeavour of farmers, scientists, businesses, politicians and citizens. LivingSoiLL intends to respond to these challenges by establishing 5 Living Labs (LLs) in PT, FR, ES, IT and PL focused on permanent crops (vineyards, olive groves, chestnuts, hazelnuts and apple orchards), comprising at least 50 demonstration sites and 10 lighthouses, and with active participation of more than 2000 local actors. These LLs will focus on improving healthy soils and ecosystem services through co-creating, co-implementing and co-testing (digital) solutions to reduce erosion, improve soil structure, reduce the impacts of the intensive use of fertilizers and pesticides, increase water storage, enhance soil biodiversity, and the overall resilience of soil. By promoting locally adjusted innovative solutions, spreading sustainable soil management practices and enhancing soil literacy, LivingSoilLL will contribute to the overall improvement of soil health and environmental resilience. This approach, applied in real-life settings, will mobilize farmers, farm advisors and local communities, facilitating the assemblage of formal, scientific knowledge with experience-based farmer´s know-how, fostering a forum for the exchange of experiences and best practices.

Rather than artificial intelligence (AI) getting in the way of the human experience, we harness its power to make human-human interaction more seamless and natural, eliminate language barriers, replace the techno-clutter with support. The project aims to 1) build the science-based technology solutions needed to power the next generation of videoconferencing platforms for Europe, to support smooth, engaging, barrier-free collaboration across languages; 2) exploit the all-round, integrated algorithmic capabilities offered by foundation models and self-supervised training on large datasets to nimbly adapt to participant context, cultural and regional specificities, including linguistic ones; 3) foster and facilitate business collaboration throughout the European Union by providing real-time machine-learning-powered speech-to-speech translation, summarization and virtual assistant services for online meetings; 4) defend a European vision for AI with regard to safety, privacy, social and ethical approaches, anchored in our regulations, data standards and shared initiatives and resources.|10.3030/101135798|Cluster 4

It explores new market niches by fostering sustainable value chains in untapped markets, while promoting disruptive synergies and innovation. This will be achieved through constructing a BEAGLE network of 3 universities, 1 technology centre, 1 innovating communities’ manager and 4 industry clusters with a work plan which will be implemented by the active participation of 240 professionals from 7 European countries, both innovators (from industry) and researchers (academia and tech centre) through the application to an ad hoc open call. Multiple disciplines, sectors and geographic areas are called to connect and interact in this A-I BEAGLE community (mainly those of the participating entities). By the end of the project the goal is to unveil 20 new market niches, the Blue Oceans, and to co-create 20 innovation proposals with specific roadmaps.To facilitate the co-creation experiment 12 Mixed Teams will be set, expert researchers and TTOs officers form the academia and the technology centre will merge with the cluster managers and their representatives from the industry clusters. Those actors will lead, manage, and supervise the whole work plan starting by the recruitment of professionals from their own institutions (the mentioned open call), to actively join BEAGLE as participants of the proposed innovation funnel. Three phases are planned: I) discovering opportunities through co-creation activities (workshops, survey, interviews, video-factsheets, system innovation approaches); II) co-creating the innovation proposals; and III) consolidating 20 new innovative market niches to attract investment.A dedicated marketplace linked to the F6S platform (4.4 million members) will facilitate the implementation of the project and its further sharing of results and lessons learned, will ensure its continuity after the project’s funding period.|10.3030/101131728|Other

Works that are no longer being performed – even from the recent past – are forgotten, their memory confined to small and fragmented communities of artists and practitioners.DanceMap proposes an ambitious strategy for safeguarding and promoting dance heritage. It is a map both in the geographical sense, showcasing examples of successful dance heritage initiatives all over Europe and making them accessible for a wider global public, and in the sense of a blueprint or roadmap towards effective and sustainable policy solutions at regional, national and European level. Combining excellence in research and extensive experience of delivering innovative dance heritage initiatives at the national level, the DanceMap consortium has developed an integrated, cross-sectoral approach that incorporates research, data science, artistic practice, outreach, advocacy and policymaking. The consortium is a 16-strong alliance of research centres, universities, archives, arts organisations and leading policy experts, who recognise that dance represents values which are central to the European project: It is a collaborative, non-logocentric, embodied practice that mirrors European conviviality and draws on marginal experiences and perspectives, which – along with connotations of femininity and queerness – have contributed to dance’s low status and lack of funding relative to other art forms. With this project, the consortium makes the case that European dance heritage is overlooked in its ability to build a contemporary image of the EU as a progressive, diverse and inclusive political entity. One of its aims is to ensure that dance is included in the common European data space for cultural heritage (ECCCH) as a use case for other embodied practices.|10.3030/101177556|Cluster 2

Focusing on the complementarity of services aimed at developing human capabilities throughout the lifespan, it will explore the impacts of alternative social policy scenarios entailing different social services configurations (from maternal care and ECEC, to education and ALMP, up to long-term care). SWINS will conceptualize the returns to social services in terms of income, employment, and growth, as well as bridge knowledge gaps about how these investments influence macroeconomic stability and foster the EU sustainability transition performances. By implementing a right-based social investment approach, SWINS aims to support the rethinking of social services as drivers of the EU’s shift towards sustainable wellbeing, going beyond their role as mere safeguards against the transition’s side effects. SWINS methodology will be based on three main steps: 1) the identification of macro-regularities, that is the relation between investment in social services and aggregate social-economic performances, 2) analysis of the micro-foundations, that is the analysis of the micro-level mechanisms that explains the macro-regularities, 3) macro and long term projection of the results. SWINS will rely on a variety of methodologies, i.e. microsimulation analysis using the EUROMOD platform and its expansions, synthetic panels, causal analysis of comparative microdata, machine learning techniques and macroeconomic agent-based models. Leveraging the expertise of a multi-disciplinary (law, economics, sociology, political science) consortium, SWINS will explicitly pursue impact by proposing concrete strategies to integrate research findings and tools into the institutional, legal and policy frameworks.|10.3030/101177566|Cluster 2

Physical activity is a key behavior to reduce the NCD burden, including protecting against cancers and type 2 diabetes. There are many evidence-based interventions for cities to promote physical activity, yet they remain under-implemented, with a whole-of-system approach particularly lacking, and often fail to target the least active or vulnerable groups. Knowledge gaps are: a) how to adapt, b) successfully implement, and c) evaluate interventions, and d) how to transfer lessons to other interventions, target groups and contexts. In partnership with the cities, we identified interventions targeting individuals across the life course, particularly vulnerable and least active groups, aligned with the GAPPA domains of active people, societies, environments and systems. CITY-MOVE will: 1) Develop a city-GAPPA Theory of Change and operationalise assessment measures; 2) Adapt city-GAPPA to six cities, engaging stakeholders in each context; 3) Support cities in successful implementation through action research in living labs; 4) Assess reach, adoption, feasibility, fidelity, and sustainability of selected interventions in each city; 5) Improve the development and utilisation of routinely collected data to support successful implementation; 6) Generate cross-contextual evidence on implementation, evaluation and scalability through multi-criteria decision assessment for 12 interventions in six cities; and 7) Generate global capacity through regional Communities of Practice.

New AI technologies are sites of negotiation and contestation. Different groups, based on their social positions, develop diverse and possibly conflicting ideas on what constitutes “success”. Expanding visions that define AI strictly in terms of technological and economic efficiency, FORSEE aims to develop a nuanced and enriched notion of success that will guide future AI applications and policy efforts. To achieve this, FORSEE draws from the social construction of technology to engage with three categories of stakeholders: a) institutional actors, b) “lifeworld” stakeholders (Civil Society Organizations representing gendered perspectives and Digital SMEs) and, c) the broader public. Then, FORSEE inquires into the impact of AI applications on economy, society and sustainability as well as on their alignment with EU values and strategic priorities. These interconnected research projects will illuminate a broader understanding of success that rests upon conflict resolution, empowerment of stakeholders, and alignment with fundamental rights and the goal of sustainable development. Based on these research findings, FORSEE will (i) develop a novel approach to AI governance that can guarantee more successful AI applications for society as a whole, including (ii) a new evaluative framework for assessing current and future AI applications, and (iii) a new prototype for registering risk and negative impacts. Through these outputs, FORSEE highlights and analyses existing successful AI applications to strategically enhance capabilities of our stakeholders and policymakers to address future risks and opportunities. Updating the SME sector’s understanding of success is a particular condition for the EU to retain a leading position in the AI landscape.|10.3030/101177579|Cluster 2

First devices, for example Diamond Scanning Probe microscopes, are on the market. However, large scale applications are limited by the availability of a compact hardware combined with the diamond quantum chip and their cost-effectiveness. ACDC_Q, tackles these challenges by creating a fully integrated system for control and readout of NV centres by making use of semiconductor technology. The project builds upon a first demonstration of this integration (OEAW, Infineon). The device makes use of electrical readout of NV centres, as pioneered by IMEC and developed by the applicants in previous  EU projects. Further development of the integrated logic in ACDC_Q will allow controlled excitation and spin manipulation devices. The integration will lead to compact and cost-effective realization, while reaching state-of-the-art performance, comparable to devices constructed on an optical table. The devices will be developed towards commercial applications in magnetometry, including non-destructive evaluation (Kwant-Tek), space magnetometry (IMEC, ASI), and remote monitoring (Thales). The device performance will be calibrated in the precise EU metrology facilities (PTB).

These goods are nonexcludable and non-rivalrous utilities that benefit society. Countries are the primary providers of these goods, but private firms, NGOs, politicians, and the media also play a role. A central challenge is to govern the creation and fair distribution of public goods as actors interact and collaborate in their creation. Institutions ensure fair and equal access to public goods, as purely market-based supply would result in misallocations. The rule of law corrects such misallocation by stipulating subsidies, taxes, regulations, or monopolies for certain public goods. However, populism has gained momentum globally, challenging democracy and the rule of law. It involves gaining and maintaining power by targeting formal and informal institutions, including the rule of law. Populist politics typically create an in-group and an out-group, interfering in creating and distributing public goods. This creates countervailing pressures between the rule of law and populism, affecting the distribution of public goods. We study how the rule of law and populism impact the creation and distribution of public goods by societal actors. Our analysis takes a network perspective and considers actors' interactions, collaborations, and potential collusions for a multi-dimensional view of socio-economic outcomes. We investigate how the structure of these networks and their degree of populism, a construct we define as “networked populism,” affect the contribution of societal actors to socio-economic outcomes. In summary, our study analyses how the rule of law and populism impact the creation and distribution of public goods by societal actors.|10.3030/101177310|Cluster 2

Significant improvements will be gained by leveraging knowledge from real fleet behaviour. Users will benefit from personalised data and the always-available option to select the vehicle performance type; in this way, users will perceive that individualised eco-functionality sufficiently fulfils normal daily-use requirements and will be motivated to save energy even over longer periods of regular usage. To achieve its ambition, EFFEREST brings together 11 partners from industrial and research backgrounds covering the entire EV value chain. A co-design framework will be implemented with a holistic user-centric energy management system control architecture based on adaptive digital twins, model-based optimization for component rightsizing, predictive model-based control and AI, benefitting from V2X, fleet-generated information and historical data. Most importantly, novel indicators will be identified that provide deeper insight into the effect that technical improvements have on user experience: this will help to derive more realistic development targets with a direct impact on user attractiveness, which in turn will impact the controllers that will be tailored adaptively to the current condition of the specific EV and its usage pattern, thus providing personalized and robust behaviour. Innovations in powertrains, battery systems, heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems will then be demonstrated through extensive evaluations in test facilities and a demonstrator vehicle, the aim being to make EVs more energy-efficient, comfortable, safe and affordable.

Europe is currently facing different scenarios with front and point introductions, affected wild boar and domestic pig populations, epidemic and endemic situations. While our traditional prevention and control strategies work well with industrial pig farms, we quickly reach our limits when we have to control the disease in the abundant wild boar population or in regions with a majority of backyard farms. To turn the tide and to safeguard animal health, vaccines, especially oral vaccines for wild boar, could be the missing tool.There has been considerable progress in vaccine development and while we should continue to look for alternative approaches, we must now also dare to test the promising candidates beyond simple proof-of-concept studies. Only in this way can we generate the data base for benefit-risk analysis of whether and how current generation vaccines could be employed.Along these lines, this project sets out to test the vaccine candidate """"ASFV-G-ΔI177L"""" in safety and efficacy tests after oral and intramuscular application as prescribed by international guidelines. This vaccine candidate has shown safety and very good protection under laboratory conditions and has been applied in the field in Vietnam. As a backup option, other promising candidates, “ASFV-G-ΔMGF” and “ASFV-G-Δ9GL/UK, will be tested in initial comparative trials. Accompanying the prescribed tests, our interdisciplinary consortium will characterize the protective immune responses, target the optimization of oral immunization and model tailored vaccination strategies.

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) has appeared for decades as a credible alternative but its poor energy efficiency, the need of fossil fuels and the use of existing underground cavities as storage reservoirs have limited its development. Variations to CAES have shown low efficiency, losing a big percentage of energy as heat and mechanical losses. Since the 2010s, there is a strong revival of scientific and industrial interest on CAES, led by China and the European Union (EU). For the EU, leading the new generation of high-efficient, low climate-impact and long-term energy storage research, is key to increase its energy independency.In this context, the main objective of Air4NRG is the development of an innovative, efficient (over 70% RTE), long-term, and sustainable CAES prototype, which can enhance renewable energy availability and offers robustness and safety while increasing cost effectiveness and improving the environmental footprint. At the same time, it will promote innovation and competitiveness in the European energy storage industry, while prioritizing the principles of circular economy and environmental sustainability. Another key factor of the solution is the integrability to the electrical grid system and their intelligent EMS, which will be proven by the end of the project through end user integration activities (TRL5). The project will result in a plug and play prototype, fitting into a standard 40ft container with an over ten-hours storage duration. The developed system is a rare material-free solution with simple industrial infrastructure needs, allowing its full development within the EU, strengthening Europe’s position in the energy storage system sector.|10.3030/101135736|Cluster 5

We aim to do this by producing strategies for circular food plastic packaging with Refuse, Reduce, Redesign, Reuse and Recycle approaches. Our goal is to enhance sustainable and circular use of plastic food packaging and decrease the amount of generated waste while reducing the environmental impact. This is achieved via development and implementation of circular strategies together with an extensive network of plastics packaging value chain stakeholders, and citizens and consumers.Increased knowledge on the environmental and climate impacts of food packaging systems is a key driver in changing perception of reuse and recycling. We will quantify the effect of littered plastic food packaging on the environment with analysis of different ecosystems, biological organizational levels and key sentinel organisms. This deeper understanding is an important part together with different state-of-the-art and comprehensive enablers and barriers analysis for the technological developments, business strategies and consumer studies done in the project. Our technological approaches for reuse focus on safe and high-performance material development, improving return logistics, and developing consumer-centric communication strategies. For recycling, we will optimize collection systems, create safe food contact polyolefin recyclates, recycle bio-based and smart food packaging, and expand Plastics Recyclers Europe’ RecyClass certification scheme for recyclability.STOPP has a key role in supporting the Packaging and Packaging Waste Regulation implementation in its early stages via the developed novel solutions, providing new open access knowledge and hands-on tools for the value chain actors to start-up their sustainable circular food packaging journey as early adaptors.|10.3030/101134958|Cluster 6

There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that reconciles human well-being with environmental sustainability -- one based on a “post-growth” approach. The idea is that high-income countries should move beyond the pursuit of GDP growth as a policy goal, and instead pursue policies that improve human well-being while reducing resource use.Despite increasing interest in this idea, the main integrated assessment models (IAMs) used in climate mitigation modelling do not consider post-growth policies or scenarios. MAPS has the ambition to expand the range of policy options available to policymakers and incorporate post-growth scenarios into the major scientific assessments of the IPCC and IPBES. Our goal is to provide new approaches to help steer Europe and the world back within planetary boundaries without compromising on valuable social welfare goals.To this end, MAPS will use participatory processes to develop new policy packages and scenarios, and then assess these policies using a state-of-the-art simulation model. In particular, it will estimate the resource use requirements of a good life, design social welfare systems that are growth-resilient, incorporate a broader range of environmental and social indicators into assessment models, and explore how alternative policies could be implemented in practice.MAPS will provide knowledge about policies that reduce resource use to be within planetary boundaries while maintaining or improving social outcomes. In so doing, it will improve decision-making capacity by broadening the range of policy options, modelling frameworks, and assessments for sustainability.|10.3030/101137914|Cluster 5

There is a shift towards a more sustainable textile value chain, but it is slow and needs more innovative technologies to combat challenges such as low recycling rates, substitution of substances of (very high) concern and chemical pollutants. The project Towards safe and sustainable biobased textile (BioSusTex) has the objective to demonstrate rapid development of several key technologies which will have a significant impact on the textile value chain, a need highlighted by key industrial partners within the consortium. Focusing on cotton and cellulosic textiles BioSusTex targets increased recycling rates and substitution of harmful compounds by (i) delivering an optimized cellulosic fiber recycling process for dope-dyed man-made cellulosics, (ii) develop efficient and sustainable pre-processing techniques for removal of elastane, dyes, and impurities from post-consumer blended cellulosic textile, while avoiding potential toxic degradation products during processing (iii) develop a biobased PFAS-free water-repellent coating based on an innovative methodology with temporary surfactants  and (iv) developing removable biobased, PVC-free print formulations.  Significant improvements in these key technologies, in accordance with the Safe and Sustainable-by-design (SSbD) framework, are expected to notably improve the sustainability of the textile value chain. Further, BioSusTex will not only yield technical solutions but respond to the industry needs of rapid assessments methods by (v) further developing analytical methods and prediction tools related to toxicity evaluation (vi) building a novel Decision Support software tool implementing the SSbD methodology; and (vii) creating a database compiling all the data generated in the previous stages, which ultimately supports systemic sustainable innovation in the textile value chain as a whole.|10.3030/101135372|Cluster 6

Most of all, robots lack the cognitive capabilities to understand a task to the point of being able to perform it in a different domain. As humans, during the learning process we gain deep insights on the execution of a process, which allows us to replicate its execution in a different domain with a little effort. We are also able to invert the task execution and to react to contingencies, by focusing the attention to the most critical prediction phases. However, replicating these cognitive processes in AI-driven robots is challenging as it needs a profound rethinking of the robot learning paradigm itself. The robot needs to understand how to act and imagine, like humans do, the possible consequences of its actions in another domain. This demands for a novel framework that embraces different levels of abstraction, starting from physical interaction with the environment, passing through active perception and understanding, and ending-up with decision-making. The INVERSE project aims to provide robots with these essential cognitive abilities by adopting a continual learning approach. After an initial bootstrap phase, used to create initial knowledge from human-level specifications, the robot refines its repertoire by capitalising on its own experience and on human feedback. This experience-driven strategy permits to frame different problems, like performing a task in a different domain, as a problem of fault detection and recovery. Humans have a central role in INVERSE, since their supervision helps limit the complexity of the refinement loop, making the solution suitable for deployment in production scenarios. The effectiveness of developed solutions will be demonstrated in two complementary use cases designed to be a realistic instantiation of the actual work environments.|10.3030/101136067|Cluster 4

By this approach, farms will become climate neutral, optimising their production and reducing their impact on natural resources and biodiversity, on top of providing energy services to communities and diversifying their economic income. However, there is a need to identify, understand and overcome major existing barriers perceived by agricultural communities. Moreover, current initiatives do not to effectively consider and address the complex interactions and factors from the farming and RES context, thus missing to support decision making based on accurate projections, estimations and forecasts. HarvRESt will work on these needs by improving the existing knowledge and its fragmented status, which will be feed to an Agricultural Virtual Power Plant able to run different scenarios and farm configurations to determine the best operation procedures for a given RES solution. This data will be then provided to a decision support system able to weight trade-offs and key indicators to provide ad-hoc recommendations to farmers and policy makers, thus enabling the consecution of improved production rates on renewable energy, food & feed within agro communities. For the successful execution of HarvRESt and implementation of recommendations, a multi-actor approach fostering co-creation sessions together with the provision of training materials for farmers empowerment will be implemented. The full approach of HarvRESt will be supported and executed at 4 use cases representing different topologies of farms, a diversity of stakeholders and organizational structures, distinct geographical conditions and a wide variety of RES technologies.

UNDERCOVER aims to transform deep CRM exploration, introducing a paradigm shift by extending the mineral systems concept, currently underutilised in quantitative exploration, to exploration relevant spatial scales. UNDERCOVER integrates key technologies developed by EU academia and companies:- Low-cost lithosphere-scale surveys (e.g., MT and passive seismic) in full 3D target prospective regions.- Regional scale mapping using innovative airborne techniques for identifying exploration targets beyond 1 km depth.- Improved cost efficiency for high-resolution, deeply penetrating seismic and EM methods (e.g., compressive sensing or drones) for deposit study and environmental exploitation planning.- Application of AI and joint inversion methods to integrate multi-scale, multi-method, geological, geochemical, and geochronological data, resulting in a 4D multi-scale mineral systems model.- Incorporation of ESG studies to increase social acceptance and the adoption of our technologies.- Introduction of UNFC guidelines, integral in our novel exploration strategy as part of the Value of Information.UNDERCOVER’s strategy envisions public-private partnerships collecting precompetitive regional and lithospheric data across Europe. Companies can leverage this data to de-risk exploration programs and enhance funding prospects. The anticipated impacts are substantial – a systematic and reliable approach to deep exploration could double the EU CRM potential, achieved at a lower cost than conventional methods.

This missing link entails predictive capability in terms of the consequences of actions on the provision of soil functions and associated ecosystem services, taking into account soil use, soil contamination and various drivers such as climate change. Hence the primary scientific question addressed in PHISHES is: “How do soil use and soil contamination influence soil functions and associated ecosystem services, in the presence of major drivers such as climate change, and how can we predict the impacts of mitigation and adaptation measures?”. While most research teams address this question in a qualitative / semi-quantitative fashion, using, e.g., multicriteria analysis and indicators of soil health, the ambition of PHISHES is to provide quantitative predictive capability via a PHISHES Digital Platform. To achieve this, PHISHES will build upon several pre-existing integrated simulation tools; in particular the MIKE SHE model that provides a flexible framework for integrated hydrologic modelling and the DAISY model, a well-tested mechanistic agro-ecological model of the soil-plant-atmosphere system. The efficient coupling between such models will significantly enhance the ability to assess the impact of changes in land use on soil ecosystem services.

Moreover, the COVID pandemic and the recent war in Ukraine has revealed that (health, environment, energy,…) chocks in our systems create new technology needs and gaps in our access to necessary technologies in Europe itself. Impact licensing is a strategic instrument to optimize the valorization potential of technologies and data without losing sight of the economic dimension. It is a time-bounded voluntary permission granted by a technology holder to bring at preferred conditions an IP, a technology, a product or a service to a pre-defined market for a specified societal purpose which can be a societal or environmental unmet need or triggered by a crisis. Moreover, the impact licensing mechanism creates for technology holders important incentives for market exploration, reverse (frugal) innovation and access to real world data on technology performance and outcome /impact indicators.This project aims to develop an integrated toolkit (6 instruments and 2 training modules)  and a network of intermediaries (=clearing houses) across the EU to introduce impact licensing as an IP instrument (a) for societal value creation with focus on the UN SDG goals, (b) as an instrument for a resilient Europe that guarantees access to technology and data during crisis , (c) as a driver for innovation and research through performance data access and insight for technology improvement and (d) as a smart tool for (emerging) market exploration.|10.3030/101135720|Cluster 4

Since agriculture is by far the largest consumer of freshwater, sustainable production practices are the only way forward to mitigate the most severe impacts on the local environment, which is also acknowledged by the Australian agricultural sector. Scalable and transparent methods to report on the water productivity and sustainability are needed to allow agriculture industries to continuously improve their productive and sustainable water use. However, local reporting initiatives using in-situ data are labour-intensive, costly, and not scalable. Therefore, we aim to inform the Australian agricultural sector on the advances in EO-based water productivity and sustainability reporting. We will accomplish this by integrating state-of-the-art EO-based estimates on irrigation and precipitation and alternatives to locally sourced inputs with advanced hydrological models. Contrasting to most existing EO-based water productivity and sustainability indicators, we aim to include most of the intricacies of irrigation systems and the consequent losses that occur during the application of irrigation, enhancing the reliability of the indicators. The proposed system will not only deliver these indicators for the entire Australian continent but also provide transparency on each of the components used to calculate the indicators. Although we will focus on the entire Australian irrigated agricultural sector, we have a particular interest in the Namoi and Murrumbidgee River valleys where we have already established lasting relationships with local stakeholders. The REINFORM consortium is well experienced in leading and implementing EU funded projects. With 4 research focussed SMEs, a private sector company and a university, we have the scientific depth needed for research and development, as well as the commercial insight and flexibility needed to meet market demand beyond REINFORM.|10.3030/101180201|Other

The focus is on protective policies and their consequences for individuals, groups of citizens and non-citizens as well as for democracy, political participation, and mobilisation. Such policies, and the emotional dynamics related to them, increasingly dominate politics in the current age of insecurity. Fear, anger, pride and hope are only some of the emotions that are often involved in political interactions and sometimes with important consequences, as events such as the Yellow Vest protests illustrate. PROTEMO asks: (1) How do political actors perceive and influence the emotional needs of citizens (and non-citizens) and how does this play out in the policy process? (2) What emotional reactions, judgements and actions elicit protective policies among individuals and publics in society? (3) How do citizens’ emotional reactions feed back on the policy process? Answering these questions allows us to study emotional responsiveness - a crucial yet neglected aspect of representative democracy.To do so, we will field a representative survey of 11 countries, design experiments, make focused comparisons of a smaller range of specific policies (e.g. pandemic responses, climate change) and conduct several “deep dives” where, we investigate how underprivileged citizens, migrant women of color, and refugees from Ukraine form emotional needs towards protection and build discursive spaces to articulate them in the public sphere. Bringing together perceptions of emotions by political actors and emotional reactions of citizens and non-citizens to protective policies with an analysis of the emotionality of the policy process toward protective policies allows us to contribute to a broader debate on the future of representative democracy and affective citizenship. PROTEMO’s results will lead to improved EU policy-making and enhanced communication of evidence-based policies.|10.3030/101132433|Cluster 2

As access to affordable housing becomes limited, inflation and accelerating energy prices pinpoint that energy poverty and housing inequalities mutually reinforce. Within this context, the deep renovation of the existing housing stock is promoted as key policy action. However, despite policy efforts from the EU to the local state, there are growing concerns that the transformation of housing markets may further aggravate the existing housing inequalities and energy poverty. To offer more equitable pathways to the green transition, PREFIGURE puts the spotlight on existing and emerging individual and collective efforts of policy, market,  and social innovation. The project aims at identifying, tracing, analysing and networking emerging and active ‘prototypes of change’ with regard to the housing-energy efficiency/energy poverty nexus. Research objectives are to: (i) offer understanding of how practices of innovation contribute to affordable housing renovation schemes that disrupt existing housing inequalities and energy poverty; (ii) identify how housing policies trigger sustainable housing and energy transitions, how financial incentives for energy-efficient buildings are accessed by different types of owners and tenants, and how different user groups perceive sustainable housing and energy transitions, with a particular focus on income and wealth polarisation consequences on vulnerable groups; and (iii) mobilise knowledge about innovative practices for sustainable housing and energy transitions and co-create evidence-based policy solutions. Method innovation relies on fusing transformative qualitative and quantitative with technological and real-laboratory research to co-create and up-scale knowledge and practices that signal the green transition.|10.3030/101132777|Cluster 2

State-of-the-art technologies for solar fuel production (including natural photosynthesis) suffer from low solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, low production rates and prohibitively high costs. Within the framework of SUN-PERFORM, we will address these critical limitations through an innovative biohybrid approach based on innovations in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. SUN-PERFORM aims to: 1) to develop artificial nanocrystal light-harvesting systems, to efficiently harvest a larger part of the solar light spectrum, 2) to generate advanced microalgal solar cell factories, by introducing synthetic pathways for a more efficient, rapid conversion of light energy and CO2 into lipid fuel precursors. Microalgal lipids are promising hydrocarbons for fuels, being already approved production pathways for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. However, current lipid production is still too inefficient and slow, hindering the cost-effective generation of renewable fuels. Through the implementation and integration of groundbreaking innovations at a pilot scale, SUN-PERFORM aims to achieve a remarkable four-fold increase in the existing solar-to-fuel efficiency. This will be demonstrated across two case studies reflecting the different solar irradiances received in Europe and Africa. In addition to technical advancements, SUN-PERFORM will comprehensively evaluate the sustainability, techno-economic and social aspects of this novel route, to guide its development as a truly sustainable, secure and affordable production platform.

The iron and steel industry is responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), constituting 5.7% of the total emissions in the EU (2.2 tonnes CO2 per tonne of crude steel cast, refer to World Steel data). Several European steel producers (including ArcelorMittal) have committed to fulfilling the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and aligning with the European Union's target of achieving zero emissions by 2050, as part of the Green Deal initiative. These engagements entail a shift from the predominant method of steel production, currently reliant on blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace (BF/BOF) technology, to cleaner production techniques characterized by significantly lower CO2 emissions. As the industry shifts toward cleaner production methods, particularly those utilizing electric-arc furnaces (EAF) and emphasizing the recycling of iron scrap, concerns arise about the potential contamination of steel with residual elements like Cu, Sn, As, Sb, and P.The NANO-S-MART project emerges as a response to this pressing need, focusing on the systematic and in-depth analysis of the impact of residual elements in martensitic steels. Martensitic steels, vital across key sectors such as construction, automotive, energy, and defense, play a pivotal role in the EU's efforts to achieve climate neutrality and increase renewable energy usage. The project addresses macro, micro, and nano-scale considerations, encompassing the entire steel production process. NANO-S-MART project aims to provide clear guidelines for redesigning grades and validating technologies in relevant environments. By bridging knowledge gaps and embracing cutting-edge technologies, NANO-S-MART endeavors to revolutionize martensitic steel production, contributing to a sustainable and circular economy in the EU.|10.3030/101178431|Cluster 4

However, the size, cost and scalability of current devices prevents them from reaching their full potential. Photonics is one of the key enabling technologies for quantum technology. In particular, photonics integrated circuits (PICs) with their wafer-level manufacturing based on microfabrication technologies can provide the reduction in size and cost and enable next generation scalable quantum technologies. To fully achieve this goal, an universal PIC technology that can serve most quantum applications is needed.In QU-PIC, we selected the Al2O3 integrated photonics platform as backbone technology for the development of quantum PICs thanks to its excellent low propagation loss performance and wide operating spectral region from the ultraviolet (200 nm) until the mid-infrared. A large range of PIC building blocks is developed in QU-PIC, focusing on areas where materials or integration technologies are not yet available. Several light sources, including multiwavelength tunable lasers with operation at 399 nm, 411 nm and 935 nm on the PIC, UVC external cavity lasers emitting at 280 nm, sources of squeezed photons, single photon detectors, programmable ASICs and the required packaging and assembly technologies will be investigated. An open PDK will group all the developed quantum building blocks to accelerate innovation from the initial idea to an actually manufactured system. Two application demonstrators will be implemented using the developed building blocks, namely a source of GKP states for quantum processing and an atomic clock based on Yb+ ions for quantum sensing.

The application of VINNY nanoformulations will allow contributing to the ultimate switch from intensive to sustainable agriculture in viticulture, on a global scale. This will be achieved using natural-based green circular economy concepts: i) grapevine to grapevine plant full cycle approach where  microbiome-based metabolites and bioactives from different vineyards in Europe (Portugal, Spain, Austria and Denmark) will be investigated to form potent cocktails with antifungal and plant protection properties and ii) industrial by-products, namely carbon and nitrogen (N), phosphorous (P) and potassium (K) NPK-rich actives from sludges, originated from local waste water treatment plants (WWTPs) in Austria and Denmark from meat industry (MI), to be used as biofertilizers. The project is focused on stabilization and boosting the efficacy of these actives by using 2 different bioplatforms: the nanoformulation/encapsulation of BPs and the impregnation on agrotextiles with BFs. The platforms will be based on biodegradable, renewable and abundant bioresources from plants or, in the case of biopesticides, on dynamically active nanoformulations, i.e., based on stimuli responsive biopolymers with capacity of releasing the active and improving their efficacy upon external stimuli (wind) and/or internal clues (enzymes in fungi). VINNY will then validate these platforms according to their efficacy using in vitro, ex vivo and in plant testing against vine prevalent pathogens and evaluate their biocompatibility, confirm the absence of nanotoxicity, and in field tests with the best performing candidates in 4 EU vineyards.

A significant way to achieve this is by reducing wing aerodynamic drag and loading. An attractive approach to this is through wing shape morphing, aeroelastic control, and lightweight structures. However, morphing requires low wing stiffness, aeroelastic control requires high wing stiffness, and lightweight structures require different composite materials. The MechaTwing project aims to resolve these contradictions by introducing a new, innovative design of a MechaTronic Wing, using the scientific and innovative competencies of project partners in disciplines such as Aeronautics, Mechatronics, Structural Design, Material Mechanics, Additive Technologies, and Robotics. Around this research topic as the backbone, the twinning activities between the Czech Technical University in Prague (CTU) and three top aerospace research institutions (the German Aerospace Center, Politecnico di Torino, and Technische Universität Wien) are organized. The main MechaTwing objective is to bolster CTU's excellence capacity and resources, thereby closing the still apparent research and innovation gap within the EU. CTU aims to achieve this through a targeted knowledge exchange with project partners, institutions renowned for their substantial industry alignment and collaboration. This will involve the secondments of 11 CTU researchers and students and 4 administrative workers to these institutions, exposing them to state-of-the-art practices. Expert mentoring will further support CTU's early-stage researchers and research support staff. The project partners will send specialists to CTU, enhancing its academic environment. CTU will also conduct workshops and seminars to integrate new knowledge and techniques. By incorporating CzechInvest as an associated partner, the consortium will enhance CTU's efforts to strengthen its relationships with both local and international business and investment communities.|10.3030/101159722|Other

The vast majority of EU citizens share these values. At the same time, democracies are in crisis. Populist parties are fuelling fears and spreading the narrative that migration leads to a loss of identity. There is no doubt that migration always raises the question of identity and belonging. How do we organize integration and participation in such a way that cohesion is created despite diverse identities? The project """"Identities - Migration - Democracy"""" (We-ID) is therefore concerned with the transformation of individual and collective identities, social and territorial cohesion and democracy under the conditions of demographic change, particularly with regard to migration and growing population diversity. We-ID follows an innovative research path by a) analysing the impact of migration on identities, belonging, cohesion and democracy, taking into account both the impact on host communities and the changes in the identities of migrants and their descendants, and b) elaborating the interrelationship between identities, cohesion, resilience and democracy. In addition to quantitative data analysis, we will use qualitative methods at the local level (e.g. pilot study in a border region, content analysis, case studies) to look for factors that strengthen resilient democratic communities. By consistently pursuing a transdisciplinary approach within our Policy, Advocacy and Research Lab (We-PARL) throughout the project, we will create a platform for mutual learning between different stakeholders from the European to the local level, while at the same time contributing to evidence-based and thoroughly discussed policy recommendations. In addition, based on our findings, we will develop materials such as toolboxes that can be used by practitioners and local actors (We-SCOUTS)."""|10.3030/101177925|Cluster 2

Snall4Good will develop multifunctional management and business models for owners of small forest financially enabled by schemes for PES with focus on biodiversity and carbon farming. The management models are supported by digital and AI solutions to improve the capacity and engagement of small-forests owners. To ensure the long-term impact the models must be aligned with the motivations of the individual owners and the local ecosystem and socioeconomic conditions. Hence, Small4Good focuses on understanding the motivations of small-forest owners and pursues the development of business and management models through a multi-actor living lab approach in four regions across Europe. This follows a co-creation approach that promotes rapid acceptability, prototyping, and implementation to outline realistic locally adapted pathways towards multifunctionality that are aligned with the ambitions outlined in the EU Forest Strategy. The lessons learned will be used to enable small-forest owners across Europe to enter the pathway towards sustainable and multifunctional management as a basis for a fair and inclusive transition towards the bioeconomy.

From a health and societal perspective, the number of colonoscopies is bound to increase as they are the only way to screen patients for early cancer detection. Many European countries have national screening programs. This is a very big market in need of improved technology.IRE enables a new generation of intelligent robots that through data, simulation and learning can interact with the interior of a living human while communicating with a human operator. The huge variation of human anatomy and the dynamic effect of human physiology make it a complicated navigational task to use endoscopes. Entanglement, haemorrhage, and perforation risks create a critical and difficult environment to navigate autonomously in where even trained human operators meet challenges. We exploit one of the largest datasets on real-life colonoscopies with more than 2,000 operations to learn safe navigation, combined with simulated training on a population of biomechanical models of the abdominal region.IRE boosts the design and configuration of the robotic endoscope using digital twins and simulation, and careful inclusion of clinicians will speed up the process of integration. IRE will raise the level of autonomy by building upon simulation, imaging, and learning to yield an increased interpretation and understanding of the complex real- world environments, capable of anticipating the effect of human motions, adapting and replanning to avoid entanglement.|10.3030/101135082|Cluster 4

The CONCERTO project aims to strengthen the European research ecosystem by creating an innovative scientific collaborative framework that enhances our understanding, monitoring, and modelling of the terrestrial cycle (CC), and leads to reduced uncertainty and ESM convergence. This framework has three main elements: the exploitation of novel Earth Observation (EO) data, the innovation of process models fed by these data, and Data Assimilation (DA) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. The consortium includes European experts and institutes active in these areas.CONCERTO will advance the representation of land cover, leaf area index (LAI) and management intensity through new maps of high resolution with layers relevant for the CC. The new management map will enhance the creation of a new biomass production map. Further, CONCERTO will prepare for the ingestion of FLEX data in land surface models (LSM) through DA, and exploit Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI HCHO indicative of biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. As step towards moving away from prior (static) parameterizations, the novel P model will be used to ingest these new data sources. This will enhance understanding of ecosystems responses to climate extremes, fires, and vegetation recovery from them, and the parameterization of LSMs included in ESMs. Novel representations of the underrepresented processes of lateral carbon fluxes through outgassing of CO2 from rivers will be developed. Dedicated seasonal and climate experiments will demonstrate how improved representation of land surface processes benefit the accuracy and trustworthiness of global Earth System simulation.

Massive consumption of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a significant contributing factor. Viticulture ranks high among the crops that depend on a massive consumption of chemical pesticides, consuming approximately sixty percent of the fungicides applied in the EU, making it a priority target for reducing the use of chemical plant protection products. At the same time, grapevine is economically and culturally important in the EU, with wine being the largest EU agri-food sector.Recent advances and new perspectives in grapevine breeding have opened the possibility for GrapeBreed4IPM to address the reduction of fungicides and preserve biodiversity. Lessons learned from past experience in viticulture have shown that success in improving sustainability relies on global involvement of all actors. Therefore, we brought together the top European research groups in grapevine breeding and involved different stakeholders along the grapevine industry value chain in a multi-actor and co-design approach to produce the best insights for maximum impact. The project will develop grapevine varieties with resistance to relevant diseases, adapted to local environmental and pedoclimatic conditions, and with the goal of reducing reliance on chemical pesticides. In addition, the project will provide farmers, winegrowers and advisers with best practices and guidelines for integrated pest management, adapted to disease-resistant varieties, as ingredients for their largest possible adoption and leading to a long-awaited more environmentally friendly and sustainable viticulture in Europe.

SSD is expected to reduce the consumption of energy radically, leading to 60% energy savings in a drying process, representing ~40% energy savings on the entire production line. It also demonstrates a concept that can lead to CO2 emission-free paper and board manufacturing, and an increase in the share of renewable energy. In a long term, the energy savings potential in Europe is 127 TWh or 6 B€ annually for paper and board manufacturers. In addition to pulp and paper sectors, the developed concepts are expected to be suitable for chemical industry and wood processing applications. Through the developed SteamDry concept, the technology suppliers can increase their market share revenue 230-345 M€ annually in Europe. The global annual energy savings potential is 870 TWh, almost 7x of European energy savings and market potential.The developed solution can be installed on either existing infrastructure or on newbuilt machines with low CAPEX and OPEX creating new opportunities for technology suppliers and savings for the users of this technology. Results ultimately lead to the prosperity of these companies and the CO2-savings targets of the EU.

In both cases the proposed approach is to take a shortcut by remanufacturing the components at the level of sheet metal and composite panels instead of converting them to secondary raw material. This will be achieved through (thermo-)forming processes that allow the re-shaping of parts and components to give them a second and third life. These remanufacturing processes will be supported by a set of digital tools that build upon a digital component passport. The tools will enable efficient dismantling processes to extract sheets or panels e.g. from an aircraft and will help to collect relevant information about the components during their lifetime. The main use cases are from the aerospace and automotive sector and include key actors along the value chain. By using digital information about defects, re-work or repair done during the lifetime of the components. The quality of the resulting, remanufactured output parts will be optimized.  A remanufacturing process planning software will also optimize the match between input components and targeted output parts.The COMPASS project will initiate more than 6M€ of private investments in technology development and implementation of remanufacturing process in the use cases investigated in the project.

Population growth, food resource constraints and increasing recognition of environmental challenges related to food production position aquaculture as a key component of a healthy diet and sustainable food source. As a result, aquaculture is the fastest growing food industry in the world - a trend that is expected to continue for years to come. However, its growth presents a series of environmental challenges including Nitrogen and Phosphorus (N+P) emissions from sludge (and consequential eutrophication of our water bodies), significant waste streams, and unsustainable feed sources. Each of these challenges are exacerbated by the fact that countries such as Norway, which produces more aquaculture products than the EU combined, aims to grow its sector by five times in the next 25 years. Important regulation that govern N+P emissions therefore limit production growth. This dilemma presents a fantastic opportunity for AQUAPHOENIX. We will demonstrate a novel SludgeCollect infrastructure in seven regional DEMO sites in Norway and Finland, which are incorporated into existing open pen aquaculture farms. Validation of SludgeCollect, together with significant political will backing our project, will pave the way for our ability to simultaneously increase aquaculture production while reducing N+P emissions to promote healthy seas. What's more, we will test and develop a variety of valorisation pathways that will commodify sludge as a circular resource for producing renewable energy, sustainable agriculture fertiliser, and novel food and feed ingredients. The AQUAPHOENIX consortium recognises its ability to respond to this opportunity and is partnering with leading aquaculture associations and networks to act as a global forerunner to lead change on a large scale.

AMPLIFY will develop, test and pilot two innovative suites of digital technologies empowered by AI and XR for CCIs. AMPLIFY PORTABLE is a cost-effective, easy-to-use tool to facilitate people in different places to play, learn and perform together, especially at community level. AMPLIFY IMMERSIVE enables producers to promote live performance experiences to distributed and remote audiences. Both tools will be open-source and, although focused on music, transferable across the spectrum of CCI sectors. AMPLIFY’s technology will be developed and tested with a diverse range of creative partners and situations in four small-scale pilot trials: 1) RENEWING TRADITION: Remote learning and performance in Gaelic folk culture (UK); 2) MUSIC WITH BABIES: Digitally-enabled music co-creation with families (PT); 3) STAGE DIVING: Augmented Reality concerts connecting artists and audiences (IT); 4) REVEALING OPERA: Immersive experiences of co-creation with communities (ES). The project will involve other CCI sectors from the start, explore their needs, desires and fears about the digital transition, and generate added value as early as feasible. AMPLIFY rests on a human-centric approach that balances the tools and their use, so that the whole project delivers not only innovative technologies, new ways of working and enhanced audience experiences, but also sustainable economic models consistent with the beliefs, values and practices of the creators and audiences for wider societal benefit.|10.3030/101177413|Cluster 2

Non-institutional participation for the climate transition often relies on a prefigurative approach, thus creating spaces to incubate alternative ideas and novel forms of political participation (niches). Empowering these forms of political participation to encourage niche innovations will provoke the radical yet necessary changes in the socio-technical system for a climate transition. The CO-SUSTAIN project seeks to address this opportunity for a democratic climate transition, by defining and testing new democratic pathways enabling local policymakers to support various and novel forms of political participation and empowering citizens to act for a sustainable transition. To develop a better understanding of political participation linked to environmental, political and societal imperatives, CO-SUSTAIN will study 18 historic examples in 6 different European countries for each of the latent and manifest forms of political participation underlined by Ekman: involvement, civic engagement, formal political participation, and activism. It will use institutional ethnography and system mapping to understand the dynamics of the participation and its management, thus delivering best practices to stimulate and support political participation around these imperatives. These best practices will serve to define interventions for solution co-creation in 4 case studies, one for each form of political participation: involvement through Spanish energy communities, civic engagement through Food Solidarity in Turin (IT), manifest political participation through participatory processes promoted by the government in Northern Europe (EE, FI) and activism through the Lobau Bleibt social movement (AT). The outputs and outcomes of the deliberations will be assessed to draw conclusions for more democratic climate policymaking across Europe.|10.3030/101132467|Cluster 2

According to the 2023 Circularity Gap Report, the global economy is now only 7.2% circular.  The EU has great potential to convert bio-waste into bio-based products that can be used in multiple bio-applications. This revalorisation can directly support 5-10 times more employment and generate 4-9 times more added value than energy use.Circular Business Models in Bioeconomy (CBMB) face many challenges to become sustainable and profitable. Firstly, primary producers, the owners of the valuable feedstock, are often not integrated into the bioeconomy value chains, and they are often small scale and are fragmented, reducing their ability to negotiate with those higher up the value chain. The result is a suboptimal distribution of benefits and incentives. The main challenges in designing CBMB consist of: -lack of knowledge sharing and collaboration between stakeholders-need for new supply chains and logistical networks-difficult scale up of innovative technologies-understanding of the potential synergies and symbiotic relationships between sectors-overcoming poor public acceptance -complex and fragmented policy schemes, As a result of this, there is a lack of demonstrated and replicable systemic bio-solutions for the territorial deployment of the circular bioeconomy.The PRIMED ProjectPRIMED will co-create innovative forms of cooperation to integrate primary producers in novel bioeconomy value chains with a multi-actor approach. To do so, PRIMED will develop novel CBMB to produce high-value bio-based products through advanced biorefineries, and will demonstrate them in five Living Labs (LLab):PRIMED will also empower multi-actors to co-design a collaborative ecosystem to accelerate the bioeconomy, with an Open Access knowledge hub and toolkit (PRIMED digital toolbox).|10.3030/101135353|Cluster 6

They possess biographies that reveal their human relationships. This is why archaeologists focus on material culture, gathering countless archaeological finds to preserve what we can learn and the stories they create for current and future generations. Archaeology unlocks these stories, enabling objects to speak about their origins, uses, and evolution. They offer insights into technology, daily life, relationships, the environment, and human history. Pottery and lithics are common forms of archaeological evidence, holding crucial information. However, documenting and classifying these finds is labour-intensive, it limits our understanding of these objects. While digitisation campaigns have been undertaken, they remain complex, time-consuming, and costly, leaving millions of artefacts inaccessible. AUTOMATA will transform this process by enabling low-cost and time-efficient digitisation. Using AI-augmented robotics and sensors, AUTOMATA will create 3D models enriched with archaeometric data, providing a practical and cost-effective solution for digitisation. Robotic tools with newly developed AI methodologies will improve the digitisation process of visible and non-visible properties of archaeological finds, enhance the robustness and efficiency of 3D digitisation, improve surface appearance acquisition, and integrate 2D representations. This approach streamlines data acquisition, aided by human-AI collaboration, and, in turn, the collection of big, well-identified data will empower the development of AI models. This cost-effective technology will democratise access to digitisation, benefiting museums and smaller institutions, aid preservation methods and restorers’ work, and foster inclusive knowledge-sharing via a dedicated crowdsourcing platform.

The first one is Directed Energy Deposition of a multimaterial leading edge for a hypersonic hydrogen-driven airplane, while the second relates to the Powder Bed Fusion of complex multi-material assembly of a drone for urban delivery. The challenges in both cases are related with zero-defect manufacturing, sustainability and first-time-right manufacturing. WAVETAILOR aims to solve the high-precision in complex material structure manufacturing, the disassembly, reuse and recycling of components, while reducing the environmental footprint of both manufacturing process and the components itself. To achieve this, three main pillars are developed in the project: 1) flexible energy efficient photonic setup based on modular diode-based laser source and multi-wavelength optics; 2) full reconfigurability of this setup, to use minimal energy and material resources in manufacturing of two use cases and 3) ZDM and ZDW strategies at assembly level controlling the compliability of complex multimaterial products at machine level, shop floor level and delocalized manufacturing chain level. The latter pillar will be based on digital sibling (shop floor level) and twin (cloud level) for automatic assessment of component/assembly design for circularity; first-time right process planning using synthetic legacy data and ZDM/ZDW based on real time process and post-process monitoring.When the WAVETAILOR objectives are achieved, the manufacturing process of the two use cases will have spent 200MWh of energy less, 923kg of waste less, while the production costs are going to be 50-65% lower. In order to prove this a dedicated sustainability study is provided along the project.|10.3030/101137974|Cluster 4

Together with Marine Protected Area (MPA) managers, authorities, industries, and local communities from 12 Demonstration sites and beyond, BLUE CONNECT is co-developing, promoting, and demonstrating a systematic approach to marine conservation planning and management. This collaborative effort will result in the creation of a powerful Blueprint, directly supporting 1) setting science-based conservation objectives, 2) co-defining conservation actions for effective MPA co-management, 3) ensuring conservation effectiveness and 4) demonstrating the high potential of these tools for replicability and broader use. This will be made possible by establishing a holistic modelling framework that integrates various elements of biodiversity, ecological functioning, ecosystem services, and connectivity, while also considering inputs from stakeholders and local communities regarding social, economic, and cultural aspects when defining MPAs and ecological corridors. The project will contribute to a more comprehensive, science-based and inclusive approach to designating new MPAs or expanding existing ones, transitioning to strict protection, restoring ecosystems, enhancing ecological connectivity, and facilitating MPA co-management. By fostering just and fair stakeholder cooperation and citizen science initiatives, BLUE CONNECT will build a greater feeling of co-ownership of protected and restored marine ecosystems and MPA networks and empower communities to play a crucial role in safeguarding our seas.|10.3030/101156759|Cluster MISS

However, their training is a data hungry endeavour requiring big data to be integrated across diverse sources, which in turn is hampered by privacy legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation. Privacy-enhancing computational techniques, like federated learning, have recently emerged and hold the promise of enabling the effective use of big data while safeguarding sensitive patient information. In dAIbetes, we build on this technology to develop a federated health data platform for clinical application of the first internationally trained federated virtual twin models. Our primary medical objective is personalised prediction of treatment outcomes in type 2 diabetes, which afflicts 1 in 10 adults worldwide and causes annual expenditures of ca. 893 billion EUR. While healthcare providers are becoming increasingly effective at targeting diabetes risk factors (e.g. diet or exercises), no guidelines as to the expected outcome for a given treatment for a specific patient exist. To address this urgent, yet unmet need, the federated dAIbetes technology will harmonise existing data of ca. 800,000 type 2 diabetes patients of 4 cohorts distributed across the globe, and learn prognostic virtual twin models. Those will be validated for their clinical relevance and applied in clinical practice through a dedicated software. We aim to demonstrate that our personalised predictions have a prediction error that is at least 10% lower than that of population average-based models. This federated virtual twin technology will enable personalised disease management and act as a blueprint for other complex diseases. Our consortium combines expertise in artificial intelligence, software development, privacy protection, cyber security, and diabetes and its treatment. Ultimately, we aim to resolve the antagonism of privacy and big data in cross-national diabetes research.|10.3030/101136305|Cluster Health

Although AI and machine learning have been used in wide areas of science research for decades, the public has only recently become aware first-hand of their potential through open text-to-image models like DALL-E and Midjourney and large language models like Chat-GPT. Until last 2-3 years, the general public has mostly encountered the term AI in SciFi movies and literature, but the details of what it actually means were rarely covered in the general education. Thus, for the general public, AI research is one of the upcoming but great unknowns, often accompanied with a deep misunderstanding of how it really works, resulting sometimes in fears about “machines taking over our jobs”, but also in warranted concerns about how AI tools will impact education. As a part of 2-year TRAIL project (Year 1: Train, Year 2: Trail/Validate), we aim to take the general public on a deep learning trip around topics related to AI. The program of the Year 1 (TRAIN year) will be focused around “training”  and familiarizing the general public with the background of machine learning and AI – historical perspective, the science behind it, what it entails with special attention given to big data side of it in terms of training models, while the Year 2 (TRAIL or Validate year) will focus more on emerging tools, applications and integration of AI in our every-day lives.|10.3030/101162178|Other

Despite this, the general population of Romania has little knowledge about the impact of research on all aspects of life. In this context, events that advertise science among the general public are very welcome. Another strong argument in favor of organizing the science popularization event is that this kind of events usually take place in major cities, while in small and medium towns they are very rare, so their population is missing the opportunity to discover science from a different perspective; in turn, this lack of information facilitates the occurrence of stereotypes about scientists and their work and about the usefulness of scientific research, which ultimately discourages young people to pursue a career in R&D. The main concept proposed for 2024/2025 is to reduce the passive presentation of what means to be a researcher, by involving the people directly in different interactive activities (workshops, games, competition, debates etc.). The project is constructed around four basic ideas: Future through past; Health and wealth through a clean environment; Economic development through technology and innovation; Science for future: Research begins at school. An important objective is also the future utilization of information gathered during the event, in order to enable cooperation between relevant actors that are committed to support scientific collaboration that may generate new opportunities for research and industry and new knowledge and know how that can be shared by confronting new ideas and viewpoints.

For the other 70-85% of patients, termed sporadic FTD, diagnosis is slow (~3.6 years) with frequent misdiagnosis due to clinical, genetic and molecular heterogeneity. Thus, there is great need for biomarkers for early diagnosis of sporadic FTD and its pathological subtypes. In PREDICTFTD, we will validate a set of biomarkers and create a diagnostic tool for early diagnosis of familial and sporadic FTD, which will facilitate tailored support and symptomatic treatments and care. We will apply several new approaches to achieve this: 1) we combine 11 geographically diverse cohorts of sporadic and familial FTD with retrospective and prospective longitudinal liquid biopsy samples and extensive clinical and behavioural data; 2) we are the first to use multimodal clinical and liquid biomarker data to train an AI-algorithm as a diagnostic tool for quick and early clinical FTD diagnosis; and 3) we implement a novel robust two-stage strategy for biomarker and AI algorithm validation, where phase I validates biomarkers and algorithms on a cohort of genetic and autopsied cases and phase II assesses biomarker value for diagnosis of sporadic FTD and at-risk pre-symptomatic mutation carriers. We will apply this two-stage validation strategy to address three critical clinical challenges: i) To distinguish sporadic FTD from (non-) neurodegenerative disorders that show significant clinical/symptomatic overlap, ii) To robustly detect FTD pathological subtypes in sporadic FTD and iii) pre-symptomatic identification of FTD onset. Thus, PREDICTFTD will transform FTD diagnosis, offering potential for early disease confirmation, guiding treatment decisions, facilitating patient recruitment for clinical trials, guidance of patients and caregivers, and enabling preventive measures.|10.3030/101156175|Cluster Health

While there has been an admirable appetite to improve the landscape of participatory and deliberative democratic mechanisms at the EU level, this has not always been accompanied by adequate considerations of how to build these mechanisms to ensure avoidance of intersectional discrimination and the exclusion of vulnerable groups of citizens. In fact, the concept of ‘intersectionality’ within EU law has presented difficulties even without bringing into the picture the context of citizens’ democratic participation. The time is ripe to create a new participatory tool with intersectionality at the forefront. This project will provide the analytical framework and the prototype through which such a tool can be created in the form of a Citizens’ Assembly that can be established at the EU level and with features allowing for the transfer of a (modified) prototype to the national and local levels of EU Member States. To do this, the project moves from theorising to evaluating and finally piloting such a tool and concludes with recommendations. In this way, EU-CIEMBLY seeks to be the first project that uses an academic and theoretical understanding of issues of intersectionality, equality, and power relations in the design of an innovative and inclusive EU Citizens’ Assembly.|10.3030/101132694|Cluster 2

Root-knot nematodes (RKN) and potato cyst nematodes (PCN) rank 1 and 2 in the Top 10 of high-impact plant-parasitic nematodes with RKN alone accounting for ~5% of global crop losses. RKN and PCN are A2 quarantine pests or emerging species listed on the EPPO Alert List. The two PCN species are also included in EU Commission implementing regulation 2021/2285. Recent reports document the emergence of new RKN and PCN problems in tomato and potato cropping across Europe and beyond due to two independent drivers: global warming and genetic selection. For decades, non-specific, environmentally harmful agrochemicals have been applied to manage RKN and PCN. The increasing awareness about their negative impact prompted the phasing out of most nematicides. Consequently, there is an urgent need for novel, durable control strategies that enable adequate responses by stakeholders to prevent crop losses in the EU and beyond. NEM-EMERGE will provide a spectrum of sustainable, science-based solutions for both the conventional and organic farming sector based on the principles of IPM, including (1) optimized crop rotations schemes including cover crops, (2) tailored host plant resistances, and (3) optimal use of the native antagonistic potential of soils. Moreover, monitoring and risk assessment tools will be generated to support Plant Health Authorities in decision and policy making. To ensure the adoption and implementation of NEM-EMERGE tools in the sector, a bottom-up co-creation process and multi-actor approach will be used based on stakeholder demands from both the conventional and organic sector. This makes NEM-EMERGE a key driver for the transition to sustainable farming in line with the Farm to Fork Strategy thereby contributing to the challenging targets set by the Green Deal.|10.3030/101083727|Cluster 6

The maximum power that can be extracted from a planar wave is proportional to the wave period and to the square of the wave amplitude but, to extract this power, the hydrodynamic parameters of the Wave Energy Converter must be modified and this means having the availability of producing high reactive forces. The proposed Reciprocating Superconducting Generator (RSG) is simpler than other existing superconducting generators due to the fact that its alternating movement allows the direct integration into wave energy converters where the primary energy source is also moving in a reciprocating way. This RSG consists of a Circular Switched Reluctance Machine housed inside a flexible moving cryostat with bellows, avoiding the need of any feedthrough for any moving part. The machine is cooled down using a Cryogenic Supply System (CSS) which recirculates helium gas through the coils and the radiation screen and current leads at two different temperatures.The project proposes to build a full system prototype to be tested at the laboratory scale and to analyse its implementation into two existing WEC systems developed by two technologists participating in the project.A set of the prototype generator coils will be made from MgB2 superconducting technology, while the other one will use REBCO tapes. The achieved results for different temperatures will be compared. In both cases the proposed technology will profit from the latest advances in superconductivity and very specifically in recent developments in superconducting magnet technology provided by six of the participants, including the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), a world leader in such activities, in a perfect example of bringing the forefront technologies to social applications.|10.3030/101172746|Cluster 5

Their interaction with Food Waste (FW) remains unclear, with the existing evidence being limited and contradictory. Furthermore, as marketing standards are introduced to meet wider objectives, trade-offs between such objectives and FW prevention, need to be assessed. This assessment should guide a re-balancing of marketing standards, to effectively meet contradicting goals. At the same time, FW, once accounted as a liability, is increasingly considered a potential source of business value, with suboptimal – but still safe to eat – foods, being a case still unexplored. What is needed therefore, is a dual approach, that first prevents FW generation by ‘re-balancing’ food marketing standards, and then improves market access to suboptimal foods to prevent them from becoming FW.Drawing from all above, BREADCRUMB will (1) create an inventory of private and interrelated public food marketing standards, and will provide an understanding of their purpose and nature, (2) will create an empirical evidence base to generate estimates of FW related to marketing standards in five food commodities (fruit & vegetables, meat, eggs, cereals, fish), (3) will model the underlying mechanisms through which, marketing standards lead to FW generation, and the trade-offs between the objective of preventing FW reduction and other objectives pursued by marketing standards, and will use the results to propose a re-balancing of existing standards, (4) will improve market access to suboptimal foods by guiding food businesses to select appropriate marketing channels and to quantify their business value, and by fostering change in consumers’ acceptance of suboptimal foods, and (5) will structure the previous results into operational and policy guidance on how to prevent/reduce FW related to marketing standards.|10.3030/101136701|Cluster 6

For some young people, access to ‘art’ is limited; often understood as a luxury or a leisure activity that may feel inaccessible or irrelevant. For others, their creative endeavours might not be recognised from their own perspective, as being ‘art’. ALPHABETICA will carry out 12 pilot actions across 8 European countries aimed at enhancing the transformative effect of active participation in community-driven artistic co-creation activities. Collectively, the research pilot actions cover a range of school settings and out-of-school community settings with children from 3 to 18, as well as young people and adults of various ages. The project is informed by a synthesis of theories of youth participatory action research, Theory of Change, pedagogies of care, love and enchantment, pedagogies of past, present and the imagined future, and the more-than-human approach. This conceptual framework invites a reflexive and in-depth exploration of children and young people’s complex everyday realities, while offering opportunities for creative self-expression and meaning-making, participation, skills-development, and relationship-building. ALPHABETICA will take a transformative approach by: •providing qualitative and quantitative data on attitudes towards and perceptions of arts by children, families, educators and policymakers,•using participatory and caring approaches and pedagogies to provide an evidence-based assessment of the instrumental outcomes of arts-based education, their transformative impact, and their transferability to children and young people’s other life domains,•taking and teaching a caring approach that through arts-based education will sustain a commitment to lifelong learning,•providing evidence-based recommendations for policy action.|10.3030/101177819|Cluster 2

Urethral strictures affect approximately 0.6% of the male population, leading to persistent physical and psychological impairment in patients and imposing a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. The lack of effective techniques to heal and repair diseased urethras emphasises the urgent need to invest in innovative regenerative approaches. In this direction, bioprinting offers promising prospects through the production of customised tissue constructs with controlled cell composition and architecture. However, there is still a significant gap between laboratory studies and clinical application, which is why there is currently no reliable technology available for clinical use. STRONG-UR includes the development of modular, scalable bioprinter components and bioinks to bridge the current gap. The bioinks comprise smart hydrogels customisable to personalised urethral constructs, supporting desired cellular functions and enabling non-invasive monitoring for real-time treatment assessment. Two different approaches are proposed: a single stage in situ bioprinting approach for accelerated clinical translation and a multistage approach using GMP-manufactured components to induce vascularisation and promote tissue healing. In addition, a novel bioprinted in vitro urethral model is proposed as a human-based testing platform for more ethical and reliable preclinical assessments. The project is in line with EU health policy, addressing unmet clinical needs and supports a Europe fit for the digital age. With a 12-partner consortium composed of scientists, clinicians, and companies contributing to the whole value chain, supported by a state-of-the-art infrastructure and a proven track record of successful projects in this field, STRONG-UR represents the best team to deliver this ground-breaking work.|10.3030/101191695|Cluster Health

Addressing this crisis critically depends on fast, accessible and precise diagnostics to improve detection and prevention of infection and guide antibiotic therapy. Current diagnostics often have insufficient turnaround time or data for timely detection and prevention of outbreaks or precision antibiotic therapy guidance, and accessibility is often limited due to the required infrastructure and expert personnel. To overcome these shortcomings, and address AMR, we are developing a diagnostic based on accelerated whole genome sequencing linked with AI-assisted data analysis. This project termed “DRAIGON” includes a consortium of internationally recognized experts in sequencing platform and assay development, bioinformatics and machine learning, clinical microbiology, infection prevention and control, antibiotic therapy and stewardship, and health economics to jointly develop our in vitro diagnostic solution to target virtually any pathogen-antibiotic combination. We propose to validate and demonstrate the clinical utility of DRAIGON focusing on bloodstream and prosthetic joint infections at five independent sites, including one located in a medium income country representative of areas with a high AMR burden and reduced access to laboratory infrastructure. The diagnostic will be easy to implement and functions as an early detection system to prevent the cross-border spread of pathogens. In rapidly and accurately providing pathogen ID and type, a comprehensive antibiogram, and outbreak cluster information directly from genome data and in a single assay, this innovative high-resolution diagnostic aims to reinforce the global fight against AMR infections and enable the antibiotic stewardship goals of “right antibiotic, at the right dose, for the right patient, and at the right time”.|10.3030/101137383|Cluster Health

CROCUS addresses these key challenges by: (a) generating knowledge about which CCT business models are most appropriate for different types of heritage and rural areas; (b) creating eight cross-border living labs in which sustainable CCT business models will be prototyped (16 in total); (c) developing macro-regional and cross-border policy scenarios for each of the four EU macro-regions (Baltic Sea, Adriatic and Ionian, Alpine, and Danube); and (d) synthesising knowledge and experience from the project to create tools and resources that RRA across Europe and beyond can use to develop sustainable and inclusive CCT in the future.CROCUS will achieve this through its ambitious multi-scalar research design, innovative cross-border living labs, and participatory processes of sustainable business model prototyping. The consortium brings together leading scholars and practitioners that have extensive experience with cross-border tourism development projects, stakeholder engagement, and policy analysis. It will be the first systematic study of different types of cross-border CCT cooperation in RRA. The impact of CROCUS will be to increase sustainable and inclusive CCT and cross-border cooperation in RRA across Europe, thus unleashing the potential of cultural heritage as a driver of sustainable innovation.|10.3030/101132454|Cluster 2

The project raises awareness of and explores well-considered darkness with high-quality architectural lighting design and light art as an asset in relation to cultural heritage, which can be cherished and harnessed to boost cultural-led innovation and attract strategic investments to cultural heritage and Cultural and Creative Industries (CCI). This is achieved through creating a Europe-wide collaborative network of 3 cities, 5 research institutions and 2 societies, which conduct 5 artistic pilot trials in cultural heritage sites in 5 countries. The pilot trials develop design strategies and solutions for more sustainable, aesthetic and socially feasible dark-time experiences through co-design with local stakeholders. The piloting process, which consists of context mapping, co-design, pilot production and evaluation processes, brings together researchers, CCIs professionals (e.g. artists, lighting designers, architects), citizens, local societies, and municipality actors. Thus, methodology of the project is transdisciplinary, participatory and integrative: The disciplines included in the project consortium are architecture, light-art, cultural heritage, urban design and planning, lighting design, photometrics, engineering, media- and neurotechnology, environmental psychology, cultural anthropology, scenography, and performing arts. Importantly, the evaluated results are integrated into the Art of Darkness Piloting Model to be replicated in other cities and regions and translated into roadmaps and policy briefs for further impact.

Currently, the generation of useful predictions, reliable and anticipated of hazardous weather events affecting populated coastal regions remains an ambitious challenge for the scientific community. Deficiencies in the accurate prediction of such events are tightly related with the initial value problem, which states that better the state of the atmosphere is estimated, the more accurate the forecasts. This problem is addressed by using advanced Data Assimilation (DA) techniques, which play an important role in current numerical weather prediction and is currently at the forefront of atmospheric and oceanic sciences research. However, although using the most current sophisticated DA algorithms, the estimation of the atmosphere is not accurate enough to improve the predictability of hazardous weather events, mainly because their linear and Gaussian underlying assumptions. The main aim of the present project is to go beyond the state of the art in DA by developing and implementing a novel and  advanced DA technique that takes nonlinearities and non-Gaussianities into account, enabling us to to improve high-impact weather forecasts. The new DA will be tested in real cases in combination with a high-resolution atmospheric model to improve the predictability of several poorly forecasted Mediterranean Hurricanes. This novel technique will significantly improve global, regional, and climate forecasts. The applicant’s strong mathematical and theoretical skills in DA together with his broad experience running numerical weather models using HPC facilities will facilitate the achievement of the key goals of this proposal.

This approach has notable drawbacks, including a lack of insight into how changes at one level impact the overall aerostructure performance and the need to repeat much of the certification process if changes are made at distant levels.To address these challenges, the pAIramid project proposes a revolutionary approach based on high-fidelity virtual tests interconnected across the different levels of the certification pyramid. A digital tool is being created, which works by leveraging data-driven simulation methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming to optimize the certification process, reducing computational time, and promoting fast decision-making. This AI-driven hybrid pyramid approach breaks down barriers between different testing levels, easing knowledge transfer and faster design iterations.The pAIramid project is completed with several industrial demonstrators, which will help to check the proper performance of the digital tool while proving that it is able to effectively bring in new solutions to the aerostructures’ field. Four different use cases, all of them focused on advancing technologies related to composites’ properties (functionalized thermosets and thermoplastics) and manufacturing processes (one-shot LRI and FDM with continuous fiber reinforcement) are analyzed. All of them will be matured up to TRL4, counting with relevant collaboration of RTOs and industrial partners, which give these technologies the potential to be deployed in the market in the coming years, as well as representing valuable information for the tool learning, which will continue growing thanks to already existing and newly created data, while spreading in the market.|10.3030/101192736|Cluster 5

Focusing on floods in the Greater Horn of Africa and floods and tropical cyclones in Madagascar, we seek to improve the ways climate services are produced, disseminated and used for making short-term and long-term decisions to diminish climate risk. Our strategy is to mitigate five obstacles to climate adaptation: 1) Temporal and spatial mismatches and lack of relevance of climate services; 2) Capacity to implement coping strategies and access to climate services; 3) Governance barriers, including fragmentation of responsibility; 4) Climate change, which can make existing coping strategies obsolete; 5) Lack of evidence on the socioeconomic impacts of climate services. Our consortium is highly multidisciplinary. Social science is strongly represented in our cross-cutting co-production activities, which involve working with peer communities consisting of actors from multiple sectors including policymakers, and community work with 100 vulnerable villages in Madagascar. Our rigorous assessment of the added value of climate services-based interventions in these villages will also be led by social scientists. Climate scientists will steer the co-production of national and regional operational early warning systems and work to enhance the skill of a subseasonal forecast model system. All the partners will be involved in an extensive training and capacity-building programme, which targets vulnerable communities, consortium members including national and regional meteorological services. Our consortium has 14 partners, with strong representation from Africa. It involves actors from all parts of the climate services ecosystem. The reason for mobilising such a broad alliance is to ensure that services and protocols are developed locally, which enables our outcomes to be sustained beyond the lifetime of ACACIA.|10.3030/101137847|Cluster 5

They are in need of a renewal by social innovation that increases their resilience and reduces the adverse effects on their socio-economic and environmental sustainability. Unbalanced development impacts their populations’ lively-hoods and well-being in general, but it affects the most those people who are already in precarious and fragile positions. SERIGO produces evidence-based theoretical and practicable knowledge on how the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) can support resilience, social inclusion, and ‘good life’ in European rural areas. Based on the research results produced, the aim is also to provide insights and recommendations on what framework conditions and policy arrangements are necessary to promote this, as well as to trigger constructive debates and collaborations around this issue involving diverse set of stakeholders in Europe.The project applies an intersectional perspective to vulnerability, as well as implements critical systems thinking in combination with community-based participatory research to investigate potentials of the social economy in promoting social inclusion and in enhancing the quality and accessibility of services in rural areas. Empirical data is gathered in a high number of qualitative case studies from 13 countries on social economy solutions implemented in local contexts. Using the multi-actor approach, SERIGO benefits from more nuanced and ’live’ insights into the drivers of social exclusion offered through the lenses of local stakeholders working together with researchers on co-created experimental pilots in five European regions. SERIGO ensures also with a system of deliberate feedback loops, dedicated multi-level policy workshops and a sustained thematic community of practice that the new knowledge generated is pertinent and applicable, and all its outputs have high exploitable potential.|10.3030/101136899|Cluster 6

We will replicate a plug-and-play microgrid developed under the ongoing Horizon project “RePower”, using solar photovoltaics (PV), battery energy storage system (BESS) and biomass combined heat and power (BCHP). To increase energy demand of the community, we will develop technologies and activities for the productive use of energy (PUE) using a circular economy approach, whereby waste generated from agriculture and food processing  serves as feedstock for the BCHP plant and cookstoves. An estimated 900 million Africans have no access to clean cooking and over one million deaths occur annually from use of firewood and kerosene involving mainly women and children. We will test and promote the use of improved cookstoves (ICS) that can be easily integrated into the current traditional cooking system. This will help to arrest intrusion into the protected wildlife park for fuelwood which has led to widespread deforestation and loss of biodiversity. We will use life cycle approaches to measure the social, ecoconomic and environmental impacts of the project and cooperate with other LEAP-RE and CCSE projects to facilitate the adoption of the results across Africa. We will identify and catalogue sources of funding including public and private investors and international private and donor funding. Attention will also be given to building local value chains for materials supplies and a skilled workforce for the operation and maintenance of the microgrid and PUE components. The REEP will be fully operational by the end of the project period and is expected to become financially self-sustainable within 5 years. Our business model will be based on a public-private partnership and include other sources of financing such as sale of carbon credits.|10.3030/101147383|Cluster 5

Multiple stressors such as climate change and pollution from local and remote sources affect human life, wildlife and the ecosystems of the Arctic. These are inseparably connected and require a holistic approach to analyses and assessments of pollution issues, and to their solutions. Using this One Health approach, ArcSolution will provide knowledge and mitigating solutions, co-created with the people of the Arctic. The Arctic is home to a variety of Arctic communities. To capture this diversity, ArcSolution will work in four Arctic locations, i.e. Northern Finland, Svalbard, Northern Norway (Tromsø) and Greenland, integrating local and Indigenous knowledge with environmental, health, technical and social science research in a One Health approach. The One Health framework will be instrumental in identifying knowledge and data gaps, and in synthesizing the information generated and collected in ArcSolution. In addition to scientifically relevant priority pollutants (e.g. per-/polyfluorinated alkylated substances, mercury, (micro)plastics and their additives, and key pathogens), ArcSolution will provide room for research and citizen science projects on locally prioritized issues. We will study pollution from local and remote sources in a climate change context, pollutant accumulation in food webs and human exposure. We will also evaluate current and predict future impacts of these pollutants on Arctic ecosystems and human health. Together with the local communities, we will develop solutions in the fields of circular economy, technology and chemicals management. Our results will be used in education programmes at Arctic schools already connected to ArcSolution. They will be communicated to policy-makers, industry and the scientific community. The One Health-based knowledge will strengthen the knowledge base and contribute to sustainable preventive actions for human life, wildlife and the ecosystems in the Arctic.|10.3030/101135051|Cluster 6

These roadmaps will need to empower regional stakeholders to innovate new, nature-based solutions that meet society’s needs for CC adaptation through better planning that is compatible with national and international policy. TRANSFORM proposes that innovating new crop rotations – the sequences of crops that farmers use to achieve their farming goals – will deliver nature-based solutions for sustainable and resilient CC adaptation in arable and mixed farming. Working in the Atlantic Biogeographic Region (Bio-region) of Europe, we adopt an explicitly multi-actor approach in which stakeholders are in charge of the innovation. TRANSFORM will co-create with stakeholders tools and methods: for Regional-level Roadmaps that describe the needs for adaptation of local people in agriculture; for farmers to innovate crop rotations for their region using the Future Rotations Explorer tool; and, a Toolbox of spatio-temporal methods and tools for stakeholders to explore and evaluate the societal, economic and environmental indicators of impact of rotations. When embedded within our social science methods, these methods and tools will leverage an iterative ‘pipeline to innovation’ for CC adaptation in agriculture that produces lists of acceptable crop rotations, and maps for planning, across the Atlantic Bio-region, and ultimately the whole of Europe. This will allow the European Commission, EU Member States and associated countries and their regions and stakeholders to make progress in attaining the goals of the EU Mission: Adaptation to Climate Change.|10.3030/101155748|Cluster MISS

Power-to-X methods are promising due to their negligible discharge rate but up to now all the efforts have been based on the use of H2 obtained by electrolysis, and the TEAs have shown that the high cost of the electrolysers hinders greatly its possibilities of industrial use.EffiTorch aims at developing an alternative breakthrough technology for Power-to-X based on the direct splitting of CO2, using an ultra-high temperature thermal plasma, with the simultaneous valorisation of low value bio-waste, leading to the efficient  production of syngas. EffiTorch aims to reach carbon efficiencies higher than 90% and energy efficiencies higher than 60%, outperforming the best solutions available presently.Some of the research groups in Effitorch have a vast experience in CO2 splitting using Microwave (MW) plasma torches. Nevertheless, recently  a compound approach that combines CO2 splitting by thermal plasmas with a quenching using the very endothermic reverse Bouduard reaction (RBR) has been developed in China that  vastly improves the promising results obtained  in the splitting of CO2 , while solving one of the yet unresolved issues, that of the efficient separation of the gases obtained. EffiTorch aims to explore the possibilities offered by a much improved version of the experimental set-ups used by the Chinese groups, including additional sophistications like the ultrasonic atomization of a bio-oil obtained by Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) from sewage sludge, the use of high temperature reactors with plasma confinement and the implementation of a secondary heating of the plasma by induction with HF frequency (100-400 KHz), that could improve the energy efficiency and reduce costs.|10.3030/101172766|Cluster 5

By granting candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova and a European perspective to Georgia, the EU has rejected a Russian sphere of influence and instead determined where its future borders should lie. But this decision has not yet led to policies tailored to effectively respond to a geopolitical context which also sees China and other state actors competing for influence. The Eastern Partnership still needs to be fitted with security and connectivity components. In the accession process, existing formats had already reached their limits with, inter alia, the obstructionism by certain member states that is linked to the divisive issue of EU internal reform. This has cost the EU a lot of credibility in the Western Balkans and will take years to resolve.REUNIR, a project with 12 partners from across Europe, examines how the EU can strengthen its foreign and security toolboxes to bolster the resilience and transformation of (potential) candidate countries in a new age of international relations.

Currently, only 5-7% of patients with HF utilise PC services, due to a focus on optimising therapy and an unpredictable disease trajectory with exacerbations which hampers prognosis. As a result, many symptoms and concerns that are not directly related to HF are not recognised and undertreated and patients are often referred to PC services only at the very end of their lives.  The RAPHAEL consortium sets out to take the next big step in integrating PC into HF care by integrating the RAPHAEL palliative care approach in existing HF care pathways. This flexible and patient centred approach starts with the identification of multidimensional symptoms and concerns, prioritise needs with patient and informal carer and formulate a proactive care plan. The symptoms and concerns will be monitored by the patient at home using the PAL@HEART application. The app can be used to evaluate interventions, support communication and earl identify new or increasing needs. As a result, the care needs of each individual patient with HF are addressed faster and better, improving their quality of life and autonomy. Moreover, this will lead to a reduction in emergency hospitalisations, unburdening the healthcare system and reducing costs. The RAPHAEL project sets out to adapt the RAPHAEL approach to HF care within a European context and test and validate its (cost-)effectiveness via a feasibility and large-scale evaluation study performed in 7 EU countries, the UK and Switzerland. It brings together experts in palliative care, cardiology, and primary care as well as professional organisations and patient representatives.

We approach the period since the onset of the pandemic as an opportunity to contribute to the destination Innovative Research on Democracy and Governance of the Work Programme, to its cardinal goal to reinvigorate democratic governance and empower active and inclusive citizenship. We do so by distinguishing participation interfaces between citizens and representative institutions to then investigate their capacity to include citizens within decision-making and governance. INTERFACED pursues seven specific objectives that move the analysis of these interfaces beyond the state-of-the-art with the aim to enhance relations between citizens and governments. The objectives will be attained with a comprehensive methodological apparatus—combining large-scale surveys and experiments with computational, ethnographic, textual and comparative qualitative methods. Together with the topical selection of a diverse set of eight European countries and Tunisia—spanning multiple forms of opposition, including opposition to authoritarianism—INTERFACED will thereby offer a systematic and inclusive basis from which to produce new and innovative research findings, and from which to scaffold policy recommendations to maximize the mobilization and minimize the demobilization of the least engaged and most disadvantaged social groups.|10.3030/101178268|Cluster 2

Personalised medicine, comprising tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment is essential to reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of life. Integration of multiple data types (multimodal data) into artificial intelligence models is required for the development of accurate and personalised interventions. This is particularly true for the inclusion of genomic data, which is information-rich and individual-specific, and more routinely available as the cost of sequencing continues to fall. Multimodal data integration is complex due to privacy & governance requirements, the presence of multiple standards, distinct data formats, and underlying data complexity and volume. NextGen tools will remove barriers in data integration several cardiovascular use cases. NextGen deliverables will include tooling for multimodal data integration and research portability, extension of secure federated analytics to genomic computation, more effective federated learning over distributed infrastructures, more effective and accessible tools for genomic data analysis; improved clinical efficiency of variant prioritisation; scalable genomic data curation; and improved data discoverability and data management. A comprehensive gap analysis of the existing landscape, factoring ongoing initiatives will ensure NextGen deliverables are forward-looking and complementary. NextGen embedded governance framework and robust regulatory processes will ensure secure multi-jurisdictional multiomic multimodal data access aligned with initiatives including “1+ Million Genomes” and the European Health Data Space.

Yet, biodiversity is the basis for functioning ecosystems, which provide essential goods and services for humans and all other life forms on Earth. We must therefore reverse the trend of BD loss in the foreseeable future, especially by addressing underlying, indirect drivers of biodiversity loss such as consumption patterns, norms and values to achieve double decoupling (of consumption from excessive natural resource use, of satisfaction from consumption). Such transformative change requires social innovation and improved, systemic governance approaches. Additionally, digitalisation and emerging technologies offer potential to support the conservation of biodiversity, increase society well-being and economic prosperity which should be harnessed while reducing their equally existing negative impacts. GoDigiBios aims to support biodiversity-relevant transformative change towards a nature-positive economy and society that will use new digital and other emerging technologies in ways that assist in reversing BD loss. Specifically, GoDigiBioS will deliver i) comprehensive understanding complemented by new insights and operational knowledge of the interactions between biodiversity, social and economic well-being, and technological development, ii) tools to support biodiversity-relevant decision-making, iii) improved, systemic policy mixes and governance approaches. To co-produce these knowledge, tools, and governance approaches, GoDigiBioS will bring together and leverage the knowledge and experience of both researchers and stakeholders from four peri-urban transformation lab regions across Europe and use specific approaches to ensure scalability and replicability of its solutions.|10.3030/101182167|Cluster 6

Usual care comprises oral anticoagulation and rate control. However, it is unclear, whether existing interventions for early rhythm control reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in these vulnerable patients. EAST-STROKE (Early treatment of Atrial fibrillation for Stroke prevention Trial in acute STROKE) is set out to tackle and reduce the individual and societal burden of death and disability by providing evidence for effective secondary prevention using readily available interventions in these patients. To this end, EAST-STROKE is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE) multi- trial to test whether early rhythm control therapy prevents adverse cardiovascular outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. Up to 1,746 patients will be enrolled. Trial organisation relies on a network of experienced clinical researchers, patient representatives and Health Economics experts. Outcome evaluation will involve a comprehensive array of clinical and safety parameters, health and socio-economic outcomes including patient reported outcome measures. We will also perform cost-effectiveness analyses to address the needs of payers and ease implementation into reimbursement schemes. The project addresses a major health burden and will provide evidence for more effective prevention of adverse outcomes in an area of high public health need. We expect that the results of EAST-STROKE will be implemented rapidly throughout Europe, will support health equity, and will prevent more than 150 thousand recurrent strokes or adverse cardiovascular outcomes over a period of five years. By this, EAST-STROKE will lead to significant cost-savings to European health systems and societies.|10.3030/101156541|Cluster Health

PREMIO COLLAB strives to facilitate improved patient care and streamlined clinical workflows addressing the needs of patients, healthcare professionals, and society.Response evaluation methods for patients with MBC have not been modernised for decades, although molecular imaging with FDG-PET/CT has emerged as a highly accurate method for staging MBC, and staging and monitoring MBC has a profound influence on treatment options and the chances of survival. Furthermore, the patient perspective has rarely been considered, although continuous response evaluation in a monitoring setting has interacted with the life of MBC patients for years. Still, no specific recommendations are provided internationally for response evaluation in MBC or in the overall management of monitoring. PREMIO COLLAB offers complementary competencies in an interdisciplinary collaborative effort to lift this complex task. In a pragmatic multicenter randomised clinical trial (RCT), we will apply the intervention of FDG-PET/CT-based monitoring and compare it with conventional CT as state-of-the-art. The objectives are to analyse the impact of the intervention on overall survival and quality of life in patients with MBC and include cost-effectiveness analyses directly informing HTA agencies and health policymakers. Building on knowledge from the RCT, we will use participatory research designs to develop improved and modernised patient pathways and digital workflows. AI-based solutions in imaging and liquid biopsies constitute perspectives with a broader horizon.The work will be done in multiple European centres and living labs with patient representatives, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders aiming to provide knowledge for updated recommendations with a view to subsequent clinical implementation.This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘‘Diagnostics and Treatment (diagnostics).”|10.3030/101136812|Cluster MISS

Urgent care services are in huge need of novel Point of care (POC) computing technologies that can specifically detect patient condition and enable Hospital information system (HIS) with real-time data for triaging patients for right care. Our goal in POC4TRIAGE is to develop robust and accurate POC technologies, from POC testing (devices) to POC systems (platform) that is capable of fast diagnosis and efficient transfer of data to HIS. We will develop and clinically validate four rapid (<10 min) easy-to-use, compact, cost- and energy-efficient POC devices with Edge AI computing models, to be used in ambulance & emergency room settings. POC4TRIAGE devices include a multimodal patch for real-time monitoring of cardiorespiratory data, novel sub-hairline non-invasive EEG based head caps for rapid stroke diagnosis, including detection of large vessel occlusion stroke, and a handheld, rapid immunodetector to diagnose stroke with clinical utility for various conditions. These devices integrate into a new Device Hospital Connectivity Platform (DHCP) that visualizes data, uses AI from multiple devices to triage and seamlessly integrates with hospital systems and clinical workflows. The POC devices and DHCP will be clinically validated. POC4TRIAGE brings together some of Europe's leading POC device developers, medical professionals and clinicians, patient representatives, ethics experts, data scientists, and health economists. POC4TRIAGE will shorten the time to treatment and improve clinical outcome. POC4TRIAGE has potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, making it more accessible and efficient, traceable, and interpretable for patients and providers alike.

Like in most RDs, data-driven research on rare haematological diseases (RHDs) is affected by the lack of data standardisation and the fragmentation of available data in close repositories. Adhering to the principle of making data findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) is pivotal in fostering collaborative research and maximising the potential of available data. FAIR principles are especially relevant in the context of RD research, as their use can help to tackle data fragmentation and accelerate scientific discoveries.HemaFAIR aims to unravel the scientific excellence and innovation potential of a Widening country (Cyprus), through an EU network of excellence on the use of FAIR principles in RHD research. As a reference centre for most RDs in Cyprus, the Cyprus Institute of Neurology & Genetics (CING) can serve as a model for raising the scientific profile and competitiveness of Cyprus in RDs/RHDs and biomedical informatics and strengthening the research management and administrative skills. HemaFAIR brings together key experts in RHD research, biomedical informatics, patient-centred research and ethics and regulatory issues.HemaFAIR will develop and implement a comprehensive training programme and numerous capacity-building and strategic networking activities, including summer schools, workshops, webinars, and transferrable skills lectures. Also, HemaFAIR will raise the profile of early-career researchers via the development of a mentoring programme, short-term staff exchanges and three collaborative research projects. Notably, the research component of HemaFAIR will demonstrate the FAIRification process on two existing platforms for haemoglobinopathies, a group of RHDs that are particularly prevalent in Cyprus, thus maximising the impact of the project on the local society.|10.3030/101159589|Other

Many IDs exist that could potentially cause IR-NCDs, however these microbes have large genomes encoding many antigens possibly associated with IR-NCDs. Given that it is challenging to measure all these 100,000s of structures in parallel, they represent the dark matter of ID-immune interactions.Furthermore, exposure to an ID alone typically does not trigger development of an IR-NCD: For example only a subset of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 develop PCC. So, genetic- and environmental aspects also affect the onset of IR-NCDs, but the exact factors are unknown for most IR-NCDs.Here, we aim to 1.) identify IDs triggering IR-NCDs by screening for antibody responses against 600,000 ID antigens, and 2.) to disentangle environmental and genetic factors affecting the transition from IDs to IR-NCDs. We will combine novel multi-omics approaches and technologies for personalized genotyping of HLA and adaptive immune receptor genes to deeply profile 6,000 patients of six IR-NCDs (PCC, multiple sclerosis, ME/CFS, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, IBD) to identify novel biomarkers and disease mechanisms.This project will represent the largest and most deeply profiled systematic study of multiple IR-NCDs with layered datasets allowing for comparative analyses yielding insights into shared mechanisms and potential differences in the role of IDs between IR-NCDs. Building on associations identified from population scale and clinical cohorts, we will demonstrate causality in gnotobiotic mouse models, and leverage machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict disease progression and response to treatment. The combination of novel assays with ML represents a broadly applicable pipeline that can be used for studying the interplay of any other IDs/ IR-NCDs.|10.3030/101136582|Cluster Health

The B-Path project will tackle this problem by establishing exhaled breath aerosol (XBA) as an evidence-based, non-invasive sample for simple detection of respiratory infections that can be undertaken at all levels of care. We will achieve this by developing and optimising two innovative, easy-to-use and scalable XBA sampling devices and generating evidence for their use in diagnosis and screening (for early diagnosis and transmission control). We will use different model pathogens that have caused epidemics and pandemics globally – SARS-CoV-2, influenza, and tuberculosis (TB) – and we will generate data on the feasibility of multiplex detection of respiratory pathogens in XBA samples, the adaptability to novel pathogens applying viral metagenomics, and point-of-care testing with lateral-flow assays. We will assess the sampling efficiency of the novel devices against a benchmark Respiratory Aerosol Sampling Chamber and evaluate performance, feasibility, and acceptability, in comparison to the current standard of sampling in multi-country clinical studies of diagnosis and screening. Impact and economic modelling will inform the implementation potential of the novel devices for the different use cases and help assess trade-offs. The project will leverage innovation in bioaerosol and material science, as well as the multidisciplinary (including academia, industry and NGOs) consortium’s track record of delivering transformative diagnostic innovation.

The CDSS will provide clinically meaningful information to clinicians, for a more personalised management of the whole spectrum of Metabolic Associated Fatty Liver Disease (MAFLD). MAFLD, with an estimated prevalence of about 25%, goes from an undetected sleeping disease, to inflammation (hepatitis), to fibrosis development (cirrhosis) and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), decompensated cirrhosis and HCC being the final stages of the disease. However, many MAFLD patients do not die from the liver disease itself, but from cardiovascular comorbidities or complications.The ARTEMIs will contribute to the earlier management of MAFLD patients, by prognosing the development of more advanced forms of the disease and cardiovascular comorbidities, promoting active surveillance of patients at risk. The system will predict the impact of novel drug treatments or procedures, or simply better life habits. The system will therefore not only serve as a clinical decision aid tool, but also as an educational tool for patients, to promote better nutritional and lifestyle behaviors.In more advanced forms of the disease, therapeutic interventions include TIPPS to manage portal hypertension, partial hepatectomy, partial or complete liver transplant. ARTEMIs will contribute to predict per- or post-intervention heart failure, building on existing microcirculation hemodynamics models.The model developers will benefit from a large distributed patient cohort and data exploration environment to identify patterns in data, draw new theories on the liver-heart metabolic axis and validate the performance of their models.

This leads to failures such as property flooding and wastewater spills via storm sewer overflows into rivers. PIPEON will develop robotic and AI technologies for autonomous sewer inspection and maintenance.Robots are rugged-by-design working in the corrosive and abrasive sewer environment. They move over different surfaces, above and within the wastewater. Dexterous manipulators install flow monitors and remove blockages of different sizes made from materials such as textiles, fats and grease. Sensors, sensor fusion and sensor perception ML algorithms for feature and anomaly detection facilitate navigation and mapping in self-similar/featureless sewers and risk-aware mission planning methods reduce the risk of robot failure. All these tools will be developed with computationally bounded resources so that robots are able to operate for days. The use of robots automatically determining defect type and size will reduce the cost or inspecting sewer networks by at least one order of magnitude if not more. The reduction in cost “floods” water utilities with data and allows delivers the right maintenance at the right time leading to almost “defect-free” sewer operation. Removing blockages quickly will reduce sewage spills into rivers by an estimated 30% of current numbers. This will intelligently enhance protection of Europe’s rivers and meet Europe’s zero-pollution ambitions in a sustainable, climate friendly way. The team includes scientists from leading European research groups in robotics, in-pipe sensing, mapping, manipulation and the modelling and management of sewer networks. Leading SMEs in the areas of AI based sewer data analysis, and robotics bring knowledge of exploitation pathways. Three water utilities bring case study networks and knowledge of practical application.|10.3030/101189847|Cluster 4

SRS are a key enabler for developing ultra-efficient propulsion systems that drastically reduce GHG emissions by 2035 and achieve the EU's target to be climate-neutral by 2050. The advancements will boost design process capabilities and reduce product development cycles.  Future engine concepts require opening up the design space and solving complex design problems out of reach for today's standard industrial design processes within the required timeframe. To achieve the necessary step change in engine design, a similar step change is needed for the design approach. Sci-Fi-Turbo fills this urgent need by exploiting opportunities in three foundation technologies: High-performance computing, high-order numerical methods, and AI/ML. The combination is used to implement and demonstrate two key advancements. First, a highly integrated high-order SRS design process is established for modern CPU/GPU hardware, meeting robustness, accuracy, and turnaround time requirements. It will provide increased functionality and effectivity at an industrial level and pave the way for the uptake of SRS-based design by the industry. The high accuracy of the methodology will also reduce the need for low-TRL testing and enable new concepts and extended operating conditions. Second, an SRS-assisted multi-fidelity, data-driven optimisation framework is developed, which embeds and exploits the advantages of highly accurate high-order SRS while leveraging AI/ML methods to increase the predictive capability of lower-fidelity simulations and maximize overall process accuracy and speed. Dedicated experiments support the technology advancement and will enable the design of net-zero-emission engines in due time and contribute to the digital transformation of the aviation industry.|10.3030/101138080|Cluster 5

Yet there are persisting challenges related to variations of tasks/environments that are intricately linked to the terrain-machine contact encountered during navigation and manipulation. For example, an Excavator machine used in Earth-Moving needs to adapt to different types of terrain (ground) underneath (loose soil, rocks of different shapes and sizes), for scooping. Such task and environment adaptation require machines to modify their “perception-to-action” mapping based on online observations from different sensing modalities. XSCAVE will leverage the exceptional representation and approximation capabilities of deep neural networks to automatically learn the terrain/specific adaptation of excavation, forwarding, and navigation strategies from data. The overall objective of XSCAVE is (i) to develop capabilities for learning performant (high-speed), safe (stable, contact-aware), and explainable perception-to-action models for terrain adaptive excavation and navigation strategies and (ii) demonstrate step-change in autonomy for Excavation, Forwarding and Navigation tasks prevalent in Earth-Moving, Forestry and Logistics industries. To this end, XSCAVE aims to re-imagine deep-learned models as neural networks augmented with parameterized structured priors derived from physics, optimization, and classical search to bring domain knowledge into the learning pipeline. The fundamental innovations at the algorithmic level will translate to unprecedented ability for the machines to plan, control and adapt their actions depending on the task and terrain contact conditions. The end-results will be demonstrated in partnership with Novatron (earth-moving), Komatsu (forestry), and Clevon (outdoor logistic vehicles).|10.3030/101189836|Cluster 4

When combined with new analytical frameworks, it will allow for statistical inference to tackle many unsolved questions, such as the role of the cosmic web in the formation and evolution of galaxies. The current observations show the environment of galaxies plays a major role in the star formation quenching, mass assembly, and even the orientation of the galaxies in the cosmic web filaments. To succeed in studies like this requires combining knowledge and experience in observations, cosmological simulations, cosmic web theory, and applied mathematics. This proposal aims to strengthen the research capacity of the University of Tartu (UTARTU) in these subjects. The advanced partners of the project are internationally renowned experts in hydrodynamical simulations, cosmic web theory, cosmic web finders, and applied geometric and spatial analysis. Thanks to the knowledge transfer from advanced partners, this project will provide UTARTU with the required expertise to actively participate in the next-generation galaxy evolution surveys that allow mapping of the cosmic web in unprecedented detail. In collaboration with the partners, an improved method for cosmic web modelling will be developed that builds on the experience of the Bisous model (developed in UTARTU) and other cosmic web finders that the partners have developed (DisPerSE, NEXUS+, VWEB). This new GalaxyWeb model aims to simultaneously detect the groups and filaments directly from the observed redshifts of galaxies and work efficiently with significantly higher target densities and the non-trivial selection functions of the next-generation surveys. This twinning proposal will help ensure long-term mutually beneficial collaboration between the four project partners, raise the international visibility and attractiveness of UTARTU, and contribute to the cosmic web studies and understanding of galaxy evolution.|10.3030/101159513|Other

These conflicts are seen as a critical challenge for democratic systems, and their importance is expected to grow in the future. Authoritarian tendencies and right-wing populism have weakened social cohesion, making large parts of EU populations less willing to change their practices and hindering responses to climate challenges.The main objective of the project is to investigate the role and evolution of diverse forms of opposition and contentious politics of sustainability transitions, and their impact on democracy. We aim at delivering the temporality-sensitive conceptual framework, practical understandings, and policy recommendations to assist in democracy reinvigoration. By exploring these intersections, we identify specific scientific, consensus-based, and politically normative goals that political communities in diverse European contexts could pursue. Empirically, throughout the project, we will (1) focus on practical understandings of the role of various bottom-up mobilizations against the populist backdrop, (2) identify novel sites of constructive democratic engagement, and (3) address the role of trust in the democratic process, including the validity of electoral processes. Building on this, (4) we will provide sound, research-based policy recommendations that balance bottom-up and top-down perspectives for democratic renewal.To achieve these targets, we will employ triangulated and participatory methodologies, including case studies and future-oriented methods, developed in collaboration with societal actors involved in the project—from the initial design of the research agenda to fieldwork and dissemination activities.|10.3030/101178267|Cluster 2

InterPED will couple RES, storage and E/WH sources (community assets) available in the pilots with the necessary know-how and ICT expertise to ensure improved operation of PEDs and grid robustness. This will allow InterPED’s end users (aggregators, service providers, urban planners) to deliver benefits to both, grid stakeholders (DSO/TSOs) and final consumers (and prosumers). To do so, InterPED will deliver a scalable and adaptable cloud-based platform composed of analytical, modelling and optimization services for planning, supervision and control of integrated PEDs (including power, heating and cooling, mobility). Optimized PED operations will be demonstrated at pilot sites, while enabling a cooperative demand response (DR) strategy at community/district level. In addition to automated control actions, InterPED intends to engage the consumers via community building (e.g. CECs or RECs), representing a still largely untapped source of flexibility, while enabling them to play an active role in grid balancing. By making it cloud-based and by ensuring system interoperability (both syntactic and semantic), InterPED will enable aggregators and actors positioned to adopt proposed business model (e.g. ESCOs, energy retailers, DSOs) to deploy the InterPED solution immediately almost anywhere, while reducing the cost to its scalability. The key strategy to ensure solutions will work well in an everyday context of consumers, is that InterPED will involve the consumers (community) and service providers in the design of the solutions through participatory co-design processes.

Despite this, the implementation of the evidence-based WHO Best Buys policies for NCDs prevention in the African region has been found to be off-track. Additionally, less attention has been given to adolescents and yet this is a period in life where behavioural patterns of NCDs risk factors are established and track into adulthood. There is also a gap in our understanding on how to implement and scale up effective diet and physical activity interventions in real world settings in SSA.Our project therefore aims to reduce two important modifiable risk factors for NCDs: unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and their underlying social determinants among adolescents (aged 10-19 years) living in  mixed socio-economic urban communities in two SSA countries (Ghana & Kenya) by designing, deploying, and evaluating strategies for implementation of evidenced and theory based interventions mapped on to the WHO Best Buys. We selected the two countries because they represent different cultural contexts of nutrition transition (East and West Africa), and both countries are undergoing rapid economic development, urbanisation and increases in NCD prevalence. The intervention delivery will take a multi-sectoral approach to increasing the capability, opportunity and motivation of adolescents to eat healthier and be more physically active. We will focus on three settings to enhance the reach: secondary schools and, family/community/faith-based settings and the digital environment using social media. Together, this project will increase opportunities, awareness, knowledge and health literacy, motivate adolescents to increase self-efficacy, guide self-regulatory actions and adopt positive health behaviour (such as dissuasion from physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours, or unhealthy food choices) to prevent NCDs.|10.3030/101095375|Cluster Health

Specifically, S2B will transfer the microbial production of butanol from conventional suspension cultivation to a tailored solid-state biocatalytic platform. In this platform, engineered thin-layer assemblies of cyanobacteria and bio-based matrix materials will synergistically enable the redistribution of cell resources, such as energy and carbon flows, towards butanol formation. Simultaneously, S2B will improve light management, enhance CO2 capture efficiency, and facilitate downstream processes by separating butanol from the production medium. Consequently, the primary technological innovation of S2B will be the continuous, long-term direct solar butanol production by photosynthetic cell factories acting as biocatalysts.The process will be integrated with waste effluent and direct air capture, covering the entire value chain from light harvesting and CO2 capture to product separation through the circular economy concept. Acting as a multidisciplinary consortium, S2B will construct a TRL4-level prototype, paving the way for a smooth upscaling process.|10.3030/101172911|Cluster 5

Their unique metabolic pathways and regulatory mechanisms enable them to survive under harsh conditions and represent invaluable resources to produce innovative bio-products, offering solutions to address challenges that conventional model organisms cannot. However, extremophile microorganisms remain remarkably underutilized as providers of bio-based solutions. Sampling extreme environments, screening, identifying and isolating the pertinent microbes is cumbersome, costly and imposes a significant environmental footprint, resulting in low yields, elevated costs, and extended times to market. Developing innovative methodologies is imperative to surmount these barriers in the study of extremophile microbiomes, and to leverage their capabilities for ecological and economic benefits. XTREAM will unlock the potential of aquatic extremophiles for the discovery of enzymes, drugs, metabolites and chemicals by interdisciplinarily developing innovative tools to facilitate rapid, efficient and sustainable exploration of extreme microbiomes, heralding a new era in the industrial application of extremophiles. The expected results of XTREAM include discovering microbes, enzymes, resistance genes and biosynthetic clusters, with a hybrid workflow of in silico and microfluidics-based discovery, resulting in the commercialization of e.g. ≥200 enzymes for biocatalysis and biorefining, 3 new solutions for antifouling, increasing the revenue of our industrial partners by ca. 10%. XTREAM assembles 5 leading European SMEs, 4 academic teams and 4 RTOs that have pioneered approaches in functional metagenomics, extremophiles, microfluidics, microbial ecology, and synthetic biology. Diverse XTREAM partners (from synthetic biology to ingredients) at different stages in the research-to-market process provides a unique opportunity for broad value creation.|10.3030/101182278|Cluster 6

With biomass feedstocks, CHP can be considered a renewable source. The capture of CO2 from biomass CHP presents an opportunity for carbon removal, aiding Europe's journey toward negative emissions.Challenges, including supply logistics, feedstock sustainability, and competition with other renewables like wind and solar, must be overcome to achieve cost-effective, low-emission, and decarbonized CHP from solid biomass residues. Additionally, issues like feedstock handling, combustion efficiency, emissions (NOx, SOx, particles), and economic feasibility hinder market development. The BioNETzero project's objective is to significantly advance three oxy-combustion technologies (oxy-MILD, CLC, and oxy-CFB). The project addresses these technical challenges through real-world testing, modelling, and the development of precise digital tools. Comprehensive regional showcase studies conducted by BioNETzero encompass technological, social, environmental, and economic dimensions. These advancements seek synergies with oxygen supply solutions such as cryogenic methods, alignment with the hydrogen economy, and utilization of solid oxygen carriers. Integration with flue gas cleaning and CO2 conditioning processes facilitates carbon removal, enabling the realization of nearly zero-emission biomass heating and biomass CHP systems, including carbon capture. One of BioNETzero's advantages lies in its regional focus, recognizing that deployment obstacles often arise at local levels. The project will assess its suite of solutions in regions in transition across Europe, and propose novel solutions for next generation CHP plants.|10.3030/101146616|Cluster 5

First MoniFun will map the information needs of different stakeholders. Then experts in different fields of forest ,multifunctionality will co-develop these information needs into harmonized indicators and co-create a technical description of EFMMS and proposals for its permanent governance and funding. Smooth routines are developed and validated using datasets of project beneficiaries for (a) using of field plot data (e.g. from NFIs) with remote sensing data (e.g. Copernicus) for mapping of forest multifunctionality without compromising the confidentiality of the plot coordinates, (b) using artificial intelligence for real-time monitoring of rapid changes in forests, (c) producing harmonized statistical estimates with accuracy and granularity meeting the stakeholder information needs and (d) forecasting ecosystem services related to climate and biodiversity for various timespans to evaluate the effects of forest policies. Grants to third parties will be used for validating the developed methods and analysing the possibilities for using blockchains for updating information from existing datasets to EFMMS. Efficient information sharing with several past and ongoing projects (DIABOLO, PathFinder, FORWARDS, ForestPaths) is ensured by including project coordinators as partners in MoniFun. The blueprint will respond to the urgent need for the development of European Forest Monitoring system and after being implement, support successful planning, implementation and evaluation of evidence-based policies, as well as mitigation and adaptation measures at the European level.|10.3030/101134991|Cluster 6

IPMorama seeks to develop the infrastructure for a whole “practice ecosystem”, whereby the more efficient development of IPM-centric varieties is enabled, while at the same time developing tools and resources to efficiently exploit these in variety-centric IPM. The core innovation of IPMorama is to integrate knowledge of host resistance with the pathogen virulence landscape over space and time, to produce IPM tools (eg crowd source apps, vulnerability maps) and strategies, which will be validated at various scales and in conjunction with different agroecological practices. IPMorama will achieve these goals by enacting the following five components: 1] Understanding the genetic composition of varietal resistance in target crop/pest systems, and development of tools and resources to allow breeders to target the assembly of resistance components. 2] Understanding and mapping the landscape level distribution of the target pathogens/pests, especially in terms of their virulence against the available set of resistance and tolerance genes in varieties and breeding lines. 3] Developing specific integrated pest management practices for the optimal exploitation of pest and pathogen resistance in varieties on the basis of the first two components. 4] Developing the knowledge infrastructure for competent use of variety-centric IPM by actors across the variety-related value chain. 5] Understanding opportunities and barriers for scale-up of variety-centric IPM solutions.|10.3030/101135348|Cluster 6

Methanol has great potential to be one of the selected low-carbon fuels for heavy road and transportation and marine freight. Technologies that are using methanol as fuel are gaining more momentum and attention globally. However, two key issues may challenge the further uptake of methanol in energy systems: i) methanol is today produced from fossil resources, and ii) methanol is used mainly by chemical industries, leaving small room for the energy sector to count on it. Bio-MeGaFuel is proposing a novel route that converts low value biomass to methanol via an intensified process with a minimum carbon footprint comparable to conventional methods. Bio-MeGaFuel uses chemical looping gasification to produce clean syngas from biomass, and membrane reactor technology to directly produce methanol from syngas. A key feature of Bio-MeGaFuel is the possibility to maximize the conversion of hydrogen and carbon (via CO2 recirculation) from biomass waste to methanol with the minimum number of process steps. The process is based on the conversion of biomass waste aimed at increasing the capacity of biomethanol production in a sustainable way and addressing the increasing demand for biomethanol as a fuel. Bio-MeGaFuel is underpinned by technologies that are being developed to TRL 5 by an expert consortium. Besides, it is backed by a strong reference group including the business leaders and market players in biomass supply, whole methanol production value chain, potential end users, and potential future players in the production, management, and distribution of biomethanol. This greatly ensures the quality of the research and appropriate exploitation of the results predicted in Bio-MeGaFuel.|10.3030/101147737|Cluster 5

These vaccine candidates will be designed based on an innovative and robust vaccine platform that will guarantee immune protection against the different circulating ASFV variants in Europe, while avoiding the safety concerns arisen with the use of traditional live attenuated vaccine platforms. Vaccine candidates will effectively induce innate immune response with the adequate adaptive immunity. Moreover, the immunity induced will allow discrimination between vaccinated and infected animals, which will be monitored by complementary DIVA tests developed under the scope of the project. Given the complexity of ASFV genome and the still incomplete knowledge of the mechanisms involved in immune response to ASFV, VAX4ASF aims to further understand the molecular mechanisms of the virus and how it interacts with the host.  The developed platform can be used to introduce new mutations based in this new generated knowledge which will allow to improve the efficacy and cross-protection of the vaccine prototypes. VAX4ASF will provide new virus epidemiology models and control strategies using different mathematical models, leading to a better understanding of the ASFV transmission at the wild-domestic interface. In this way, innovative policies and strategies for ASFV control and management will be generated to ensure an outstanding impact through the continuous involvement of key stakeholders as project partners (farmers, wild board managers, veterinaries, hunters, policy makers...), leading to a profound effect in animal health and worldwide economy.

The pandemic has made clear that there is a need for accessible, affordable and quality services, more equality, protection and inclusion for people in need of care, informal caregivers and care workers, and sustainability. To meet these goals, policy makers, stakeholders and researchers need to comprehend the challenges ahead, the patterns and drivers of inequalities in LTC, the potential contribution of emerging practices and the development of contextualised sustainable practices. LeTs-Care originally combines an ethnographic approach with the analysis of territorial indicators and fuzzy-set/Qualitative analysis to provide a new, in-depth, reflexive understanding of LTC challenges and their diversity across 7 European countries. It will disentangle the meanings of taken-for-granted LTC concepts and illuminate how , e.g., “care” or “integrated care” have different meanings in different contexts. It will produce new evidence and a novel approach to territorial inequalities in LTC, their drivers and interdependencies. The project will conduct 18 ethnographic studies or care practices aimed at improving the wellbeing of care receivers, of care workers and of informal caregivers: ethnographic case studies will comprehend the tensions, trade-offs and choices that underpin these practices and will develop context-sensitive policy recommendations.  Finally, LeT’s-Care will move beyond “best practices” by developing a new, reflexive approach to policy learning and a concrete toolkit. LeTs-Care is based on a strong and diffuse partnership between academic institutions and key LTC stakeholders and policymakers that allow the coproduction of knowledge, enhances the relevance of research and makes a difference.

As demonstrated by the COVID-19 pandemic, not being prepared for such events has devastating consequences on public health, society and the economy. EvaMobs will improve preparedness of the European Union (EU) for the next viral outbreak(s) of pandemic potential by developing a platform for the discovery, development, production and validation of evolvable and rapidly adaptable antivirals. These innovative medicines will be based on small human-derived proteins called monobodies (Mobs). As Mobs can be engineered to have high binding affinity for virtually any viral protein, this platform can be easily adapted to a broad range of viruses, including newly emerging viruses and viral variants.To demonstrate the capacity of this platform it will first be applied to four pathogenic viruses with epidemic and/or pandemic potential: Influenza A, SARS-CoV-2, respiratory syncytial virus, and Zika virus. Deep-learning and computational design tools will allow generation of tailor-made Mobs with cryo-EM elucidating the molecular details of their binding interaction. Simple bacterial expression of Mobs, the development of a semi-automated high-throughput screening platform for evaluation of the Mobs’ stability and target affinity and streamlined in vitro and in vivo preclinical validation, will allow rapid development and selection of stable and potently neutralizing candidates. The Mob with the best preclinical indicators will then be tested in a phase I clinical trial after implementing a stable formulation and GMP production. The optimized platform can then be adapted to other viruses. Therefore, EvaMobs provides an innovative, robust and flexible platform for antiviral biologics development as well as a diverse portfolio of validated drugs, strengthening the EU’s pandemic preparedness.|10.3030/101137419|Cluster Health

We will benefit from the most advanced technologies and know-how of the ROBUSTOO consortium to conduct computational enzyme bioprospecting and design (BSC), develop microbial strains for industrial enzyme production and engineer improved enzymes, followed by optimisation and pilot demonstration of target enzymatic transformations by biotech SMEs (Metgen, Gecco, bisy, and InnoSyn), and research/technological centres (CIB, UAB, IRNAS, and FCBA), concluding with environmental & techno-economical assessment and exploitation of the developed technologies (ITB). The new enzymes and bio-transformations will represent biotechnology breakthrough solutions for: i) conversion of industrial lignins modified by laccase into 100% bio-based resins as adhesives of wood panels and 3D printing additives, increasing the commercial value of existing lignin products; ii) production of intermediate and fine chemicals difficult to achieve by chemical synthesis through regio-/stereo-selective oxygenations of lipophilic substrates with UPOs; and iii) synthesis of 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid building block from 5-hydroxymethylfurfural using HMFOs, as a sustainable alternative to chemical catalytic processes.|10.3030/101135119|Cluster 6

The diagnosis and integration of bycatch data across all industrial European fleets in the region, linked with fishing effort and the spatiotemporal distribution of the species, will provide a systematic approach to jointly assess and tackle policy challenges. The expansion and improvement of the observer programmes and the advances in electronic monitoring and automated machine learning systems will enable species-specific and high-resolution data of marine megafauna bycatch. Fine-scale GPS tracking of selected species combined with AIS fishery data in concurrent time will allow understanding key drivers of interactions and infer political responsibilities. New fine-scale tracking data of carefully selected species in the region will allow for a better understanding of their abundance and distribution and post-release mortality. Sightings, fishery catches and tracking data on marine megafauna will be combined to provide a step-changes in predictive habitat mapping approaches to understand overlap and bycatch risk from local to basin-scales. The combination of timeseries of sightings, fishery catches, GPS and GLS tracking and capture-mark-recapture studies, will provide an unprecedented view on megafauna hotspots and the risks and impacts of bycatch, boosting marine spatial planning or pelagic waters. Assessment and testing of mitigation measures will identify key approaches to significantly reduce bycatch in the region. Innovative and efficient data handling, sharing and publishing will establish an integrated approach to the bycatch data community. Capacity and cooperation between science, fishery industry and policymakers bordering Eastern Central Atlantic Ocean will be boosted by joint multi-disciplinary workshops, scientific training and monitoring events|10.3030/101135583|Cluster 6

These impacts are globally widespread and occurring in all aquatic ecosystems from lakes and rivers to the seafloor. A variety of technologies and policy interventions are also now available to mitigate LNP impacts in aquatic ecosystems. Yet, numerous knowledge gaps exist that if addressed would substantially improve our understanding of the prevalence and impacts of LNP, and our ability to manage them. There remain critical gaps in our understanding of the combined occurrence and impacts of LNP across the breadth of aquatic ecosystems, particularly at large spatial scales and over long-time frames. While numerous abatement options exist, pathways to achieving their effective implementation remain unclear. AquaPLAN is an interdisciplinary pan-European consortium that are world leaders in the fields of aquatic light and/or noise pollution.  AquaPLAN aims to quantify the combined impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity across European seas, lakes and rivers, and facilitate the implementation of empirically sound strategies for managing these pollutants through novel interdisciplinary approaches. AquaPLAN will: i) provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art on the impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity; ii) assess perceptions of LNP impacts and the need for their management across key stakeholder groups; iii) quantify the combined impacts of LNP on the conservation status of biodiversity in aquatic habitats; iv) identify the mechanisms leading to individual and combined impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity; v) explore innovative interdisciplinary solutions to prevent and mitigate LNP impacts on aquatic biodiversity; vi) build an international, interdisciplinary network to assess, prevent and mitigate the combined impacts of LNP on aquatic biodiversity.|10.3030/101135471|Cluster 6

Additionally, the local dimension of N/P sources and the diversity of water and soil ecosystems across different locations limit the impact of uniform policy measures and related governance models. Addressing this is a priority of EU environmental governance. NPower will create four Regional Clusters (RCs), to guarantee representativity, replicability and impact of developed solutions at EU level: RC1 in Spain (representing South Europe), RC2 in Belgium (Central Europe), RC3 in Finland (North Europe), and RC4 in Ireland (West/Insular Europe). We will act in the paradigmatic region of Murcia, Spain, in which the main challenges of the management of N/P flows are represented, and involve the other 3 RCs to assure the solutions developed are applicable in as many European realities as possible, helping restore ecosystems across the EU. To do so, NPower will 1) model N/P flows across the 5 key sectors to create a regional N/P budget for RC1, 2) demonstrate 6 recovery technologies, 8 recovered fertilizers and 20 BMPs within and among covered sectors that reduce and promote circular economy schemes, 3) design and showcase region-tailored governance measures to halt air, water, and soil N/P pollution, 4) guarantee EU representativity via knowledge transfer among RCs, and 5) disseminate effective N/P limiting solutions to practitioners and policy makers at local, regional, national and EU level. NPower solutions will be assessed on their environmental, socio-economic and behavioural effect. NPower will avoid the emission of 483 k ton N and 2.1 M ton P, saving the EU 14.3B€.

To support targeted climate adaptation strategies, EXPECT will enable trustworthy assessments and predictions of regional climate change including extremes by developing a prototype operational capability for integrated attribution and prediction of climate. This ambitious goal is closely aligned with the WCRP Lighthouse Activity on Explaining and Predicting Earth System Change.EXPECT will identify and quantify the mechanisms by which physical processes govern regional climatic changes, including extremes, on inter-annual to multi-decadal time scales. It will do so by exploiting newly available climate simulations and Earth Observations (EOs), and by combining machine learning (ML) with physical methods. The research will target fundamental knowledge gaps related to atmospheric circulation and land-atmosphere interactions, which represent major limitations in current climate predictions and projections, and in particular in understanding changes in European summer extremes.To underpin the research, and benefitting the wider research community, EXPECT will develop tools to efficiently analyse a variety of large data sets in combination that are hosted in different repositories across institutions. This will facilitate the exploitation of recent investments into high-resolution climate models and EO data. EXPECT will further build data science capacity for the scientifically robust, efficient and reproducible analysis of the massive data assets, including novel ML approaches, and provide training for the climate science community and the next generation of researchers in particular.EXPECT will thus deliver significant scientific and technological advances for society and the climate science community that will last well beyond the project, in support of WCRP’s strategic objectives.|10.3030/101137656|Cluster 5

However, they cause multiple negative impacts on environmental and human health. To lessen their effects, the EU aims at reducing by 50% fertilizer losses and use of chemical pesticides by 2030.Controlled polymer-based delivery systems preventing agrochemical losses (e.g., lixiviation, volatilization) and resulting excessive inputs are available. However, they are based on non-biodegradable polymers and generate plastic pollution.Other agricultural plastics (mulch films and growth foams) are used to maintain a prosperous plant environment and prevent agrochemical wash-off, minimizing the quantities to be applied. However, they also result in significant amounts of non-biodegradable plastics being released into environment.PHAntastic tackles the reduction of agrochemicals and plastics pollution using PHAs, a family of bio-based biodegradable polymers. PHAntastic will develop two families of delivery systems (mulch films and growth foams) based on PHAs containing active bioproducts (amino acids & hydrolyzed proteins, microelements, elicitors and plant growth promoting rhizobacteria -PGPR) instead of synthetic agrochemicals. Products will be demonstrated with end users (TRL6) on horticultural crops and trees in Northern and Southern Europe. Experts in the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework will guarantee compliance. Market acceptance will be guaranteed through the development of business cases and exploitation strategies.PHAntastic will contribute to a significant reduction of agrochemicals (minimum 25% in fertilizers, 50% in pesticides, resulting in 23 K tons less of agrochemicals by 2050) and plastic (680 T microplastics less by 2050) in our agricultural systems.

With ELBEX we propose a pathfinder project to demonstrate the feasibility of such a facility at the European XFEL. This unique new possibility would strengthen the global competitiveness of the European Research Area and create opportunities for new user groups.The high energy, high charge density and excellent quality of the electron beam, if brought into interaction with a strong laser beam, opens up the study of a range of scientific topics, most prominently, of strong field Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  For the first time, the Schwinger limit for the electromagnetic field strength, at which non-perturbative QED effects become relevant, could be reached experimentally  in this facility. Studying the particles created in the photon beam dump opens up the possibility to search for feebly interacting particles, complementing current or planned experiments like FASER II or SHiP. In addition, the electron beam itself is at the centre of a range of highly relevant and ambitious experiments in the area of accelerator science and detector science. Within the ELBEX project, the installation of a facility to extract an electron beam from the European XFEL using a fast kicker magnet and to transport it into a multi-purpose experimental area will be prepared.

Administrative overburdening arises from a continuous increase in the number of rules that require implementation and the relative stagnation in administrative capacities. This discrepancy between the rules up for implementation and the administrative resources available results in suboptimal policy outcomes, low-quality public services, and inconsistent implementation practices. In view of this assessment, it is the central objective of SUPA to examine strategies for enhancing the capabilities of the public sector to cope with the escalating challenges of administrative overburdening. To this end, SUPA pursues two interrelated objectives: The first one is to examine how decision-making procedures and practices can be improved to limit the overall burdens placed on the administration. The second goal is to explore how administrative structures can be reformed to manage ongoing rule growth effectively. SUPA examines patterns of rule growth and the resulting administrative changes and challenges in six European States (Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the Netherlands) and the European Union. Based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, SUPA (1) evaluates the effectiveness of so-called """"rule-offsetting"""" schemes; (2) investigates how legislators can embed legal design principles to prevent unintended rule growth cascades; (3) assesses how policy growth affects the underlying administrative structures; and (4) examines citizens' experience and operational challenges linked to different ways of distributing implementation burdens across public authorities. SUPA has formed collaboration agreements with multiple public authorities, ensuring that the Consortium's findings can be directly transferred to both policy-makers and administrators in the field."""|10.3030/101177315|Cluster 2

Follow-up care of survivors includes monitoring of cancers, managing all types of late effects, and maintaining overall health. It should also involve considering the needs of families whose functioning has been disrupted by cancer. There are several challenges providing follow-up care for CAYACS and their families: i) it is resource-demanding in an overburdened healthcare system, ii) psychosocial and supportive care needs are often unmet, and iii) access is inequal between European countries.The overall goal of e-QuoL is to use e-health tools to promote Equity in Quality of Life for CAYACS and their families. It will adapt an existing interoperable personalised e-Health tool that can be used alone or as an add-on module to existing tools such as digital survivorship care plans already used in several European countries. Through participatory research, involving CAYACS, families, associations, networks, health institutes, social sciences and humanities researchers and industrial partners from 15 different countries and backgrounds, we will i) identify the unmet needs of CAYAC families and survivors’ (including vulnerable groups: young age and cognitive impairments) and ii) adapt accessible and affordable tools to address these needs.

However, the identification and therapeutic targeting of plasma membrane proteins critical for virus infection is often difficult due to the transient nature of virus-cell binding and the overall kinetics of the infection process. Our goal is to interrogate virus-host cell interaction and cellular uptake of Marburg virus (MARV), a highly pathogenic and clinically relevant member of the filovirus family. To specifically target virus-plasma membrane interaction we will use a unifying inverted infection platform that allows us to halt and synchronize virus infection at the cell binding stage. Our approach is compatible with BSL-4 environment and multi-Omics technologies. It will allow us to identify the signature of virus-host cell activation, i.e., proteins involved in virus-cell entry in a tissue-specific manner. This screen will be complemented by an innovative combination of proteomics, virus-host cell interaction analysis and imaging approaches to pinpoint and characterize the involved cellular and viral proteins, their post-translational modifications and how they mechanistically concert in viral uptake. Our unique combination of different technologies will lead to the identification of viral and cellular interaction partners which will in parallel be specifically targeted by high-throughput compound screening to identify small molecules that inhibit virus-receptor interaction. Moreover, we will use our gained knowledge of tissue-specific post-translational modifications to develop improved vaccine candidates as additional prophylactic countermeasures against MARV. Our project will further deliver a blueprint experimental pipeline for the streamlined identification and antiviral targeting of proteins involved in the virus attachment process, a critical cornerstone of pandemic preparedness.|10.3030/101191739|Cluster Health

A surge in volume and diversity of bioimage data, owing to the fast developing imaging technologies, has brought to light many challenges including in sharing open image data. Resource owners, research infrastructures as well as grass-roots communities are actively tackling these challenges by developing file formats, ontologies, metadata models, to ensure that shared data is in line with the FAIR principles. However, many of these solutions remain regional and a global coordination effort is necessary to enable seamless image data sharing. This project will lay the foundation for a Global Image Data Ecosystem (GIDE) that connects different biological and biomedical image data resources across the globe to allow metadata and data sharing. GIDE will bring European research infrastructure and image data resource owners together with their counterparts from Australia and Japan to develop the basis of image data sharing. These interactions can then be used as a blueprint to engage with the wider global bioimage data community while strengthening the position of European infrastructures in the landscape. To enable partner resources and research infrastructures to communicate in one language, coordinated technical development towards use of harmonised imaging ontologies and metadata models will be carried out. Proof of concept implementations using harmonised image data and metadata will showcase the project developments and encourage adoption of these recommendations globally. These developments will also lay a crucial and strong foundation to build a future federated image data ecosystem on.

It focuses the efforts on two pivotal pilot demonstrations: an electric thermal battery capable of converting surplus electricity into heat and then back into electricity, alongside a solar thermal battery designed to store concentrated sunlight and provide electric power on-demand. Both of these systems integrate cutting-edge solid-state energy converters, including thermionics (TIG), thermoelectrics (TEG), and thermophotovoltaics (TPV). Standard thermal engines cannot support such high operating temperatures, therefore solid-state converters are now essential for effectively integrating efficient thermal batteries in renewable energy sources. BLAZETEC advances standalone TIG, TEG, and TPV technologies by introducing innovations with higher conversion efficiency with respect to the state-of-the-art like vacuum micro-gap TIG, multi-module TEG, and multijunction TPV systems. Through hybridization of these solutions, the project introduces TITEG (TIG-TEG hybrid) and TIPV (TIG-TPV hybrid), with a targeted efficiency of over 30% and a power density higher than 5 W/cm², all backed by more than 500 hours of reliability. The integration of these technologies is facilitated by innovative vacuum encapsulation and the """"dispatchable power wall"""" concept, which enables on-demand power generation by efficiently routing heat through the converters.

In 2019, the ScieNcETogether NETwork was established, primarily just by those roman research organizations that had a long-standing tradition of interaction and cooperation among them and with international scientific contests and wanted to lay the foundation for an active collaboration also in science dissemination. In these four years of joint work taught us that to make the Night a more engaging and inclusive experience and address a large number of citizens and young people, joining forces and collaboration is key and brings added value. Consequently we have developed a formula to celebrate the Night: a major event with researchers from all NET partners institutions and representative of the stakeholder groups in Rome (the NET village) but, at the same time, we are also aware that celebrating the ERN means feeling part of a larger European community. So, on the one hand we are inviting the partners’ branch laboratories and research centres scattered all over Italy (20 cities from north to south Italy) to share NET’s objectives and contribute to a national celebration, on the other hand we have searched for partners/project stakeholders outside Italy that could help us enhance the European and international dimension of the ERN. Having based our communication strategy on Marie Slodowska Curie as NET Night goodmother, it has been almost natural to look at Poland (Polish Academy of Sciences), France – (Marie Curie Museum) and Sweden (Tekniska museet | National Museum of Science and Technology), the three countries that sort of represent three different stages in the scientist’s life."|10.3030/101162609|Other

The Hydrogen Aircraft Sloshing Tank Advancement project (HASTA) aims to experimentally and computationally investigate the storage of liquid hydrogen (LH2) for airborne use as fuel in civil aircraft applications. Size and position of a LH2 tank inside an aircraft are limiting factors for range, payload and aircraft size, and consequently play a crucial role in the environmental impact. The goal of facilitating tank design will be achieved through creation of design criteria for LH2 aircraft tanks; these design guidelines will be based on the different tools and models of derived during the project, in particular those aimed at complex cryogenic sloshing.The experimentally validated design tools developed during HASTA are to be used for both conceptual and detailed design in the aircraft industry, and therefore span a range of fidelities from reduced order models to full computational methods.

To accelerate the transition, next-generation electric motors need to push the existing boundaries in terms of efficiency, power density, manufacturability, cost, and environmental sustainability. A reduced and more circular use of rare earth resources is critical to reinforce Europe’s strategic autonomy and establish a more economically sustainable value chain. Recently developed axial flux motor technology based on a yokeless and segmented armature topology yields promising prospects in all these areas, significantly reducing the required amount of rare earth magnet material by design, and combining this with unmatched power density compared to state-of-the-art radial flux machines.CliMAFlux will develop novel concepts (e.g., in terms of excitation and cooling) for more performant (e.g., >35% energy loss decrease in driving cycles) axial flux motors, thus reducing the need for rare earth materials by 60%, leveraging high-fidelity multiphysics models (e.g., electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, and at the system level) and digital twins. Innovative designs and manufacturing processes will be proposed to: (i) increase the power density to >23 kW/l, through novel materials and improved thermal behaviour; (ii) enhance circularity over the lifetime (including >70% recyclability at the end of life); and (iii) ensure cost competitiveness (50% cost reduction) at mass production level (reaching ~€5/kW). The CliMAFlux on-board motors are integrated with the power electronics and mechanical transmission systems. The resulting electric drives will be managed by robust predictive controllers based on the CliMAFlux digital twins, including artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models, which will also facilitate novel functionalities in vehicle (sub)systems, hereby exploiting the full capability of the complete electrified drivetrain. The individual motor (with focus on approx. 90 kW continuous power) and integrated drive system will be benchmarked over a wider range of vehicles, in terms of both performance and environmental impact, on virtual (X-in-the-Loop with digital twin) and hardware test platforms up to TRL7, i.e., on a research electric vehicle already available at the consortium participants. To achieve these ambitious targets, CliMAFlux brings together the competences of 4 academic partners, 1 industry-oriented RTO, 3 SMEs and 1 LE with dedicated R&D and production facilities in the fields of motor and transmission development, power electronics integration, electrified vehicle systems, automotive design, and life cycle assessment and costing aspects.In summary, CliMAFlux will establish new knowledge and industrial leadership in key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, and, therefore, directly contribute to Europe’s Key Strategic Orientations C and A as well as actively support the transformation towards zero tailpipe emission road mobility (2Zero).|10.3030/101096062|Cluster 5

IWMs can be integrated in multi-functional and controllable modules consisting of the electric powertrain, friction brake and suspension/steering actuation. By combining several vehicle functionalities in a compact solution, the modules offer substantial opportunities to enhance the design and the operation of EVs. This is the starting point of the SmartCorners project. Using machine learning and AI, an adaptive multilayer control strategy will be implemented with historical and current data from the vehicle, its environment, and users, including relevant EV fleets. This approach will pave the way toward software-defined vehicles, ena-bling rightsizing, holistic optimisation, innovative fault mitigation and actuator allocation strategies as well as more efficient, adaptive, predictive, and personalised system operation. SmartCorners will bring a so far un-explored authority level over: i) vehicle design, through skateboard-like chassis configurations; ii) energy management aspects, covering pre-conditioning and predictive thermal management during EV operation; iii) comfort and functional aspects, in terms of user-centric cabin thermal management, and pre-emptive vehicle body control; and iv) dismantling process and recycling of the vehicle. The development and industrialization of the project outcomes will be accelerated by comprehensive and integrated simulation, design and validation methodologies to decrease development time and cost, and support the uptake of AI-based solutions. In con-clusion, SmartCorners will provide a significant competitive advantage of the European industry and contrib-ute to achieve key strategic orientations C and A of the EU Strategic Plan.|10.3030/101138110|Cluster 5

These will be based on a high voltage (HV) spinel structured LNMO cathode, and hybrid single-ion polymer electrolyte (HSICP) and laser pulse deposited lithium foil on current collector as anode. Overall, processing is aimed at being scalable and easy to transfer to currently available manufacturing infrastructure in Europe. Wet coating for composite cathode preparation and dry processing for the hybrid solid electrolyte increase production efficiency and shorten developing periods. Solvents’ environmental impact is minimized, e.g. by elimination of fluorinated binders. A cobalt-free, high voltage (ca. 4.7V) LNMO cathode de-risks on the dependence of cobalt, and a single-ion polymer electrolyte helps to develop high Li ionic conductivity (≥0.5 mS/cm at room temperature) with a high transfer number (~1.0).  Roll-to-roll PLD manufacture of thin and ultra-thin Li anodes will  strengthen the European supply chain for semi-finished anode components. A granulation process prepares uniform hybrid solid electrolyte feedstocks to guarantee microscopic uniformity and thereby the resulting electrochemical performance. Environmental impact will be monitored and materials and processes multicriteria optimization performed. Digital twinning is built simultaneously for the simulation of cell production, with further iteration aiming at improved energy density and reduced cost. HyList identifies the essential steps for making all-solid-state batteries at a large scale. It provides valuable insights into efficient manufacturing methods and helps various industry players, like machine engineers, cell producers, and equipment manufacturers,  to move toward safer batteries with enhanced storage capacities and high energy densities of 450 Wh/kg, suitable for both electric vehicles and aviation applications.|10.3030/101147688|Cluster 5

These bottom-up processes can be highly inclusive allowing to afford a genuine political voice to all segments of society. Accordingly, gender and intersectional aspects (e.g., socioeconomic background, ethnicity) will be focused on throughout the project in particular with regard to citizen participation. DEMETRA analyzes the micro-, meso-, and macro-level opportunities for DPPs across Europe supporting the transition towards a more sustainable future; focuses in particular the transformation towards a more sustainable food system as a crucial case study; systematically compares DPPs’ setup, processes, and outcomes to identify best practices that contribute to citizens’ democratic engagement and the co-construction of sustainable societies; identifies DPPs that maximize inclusiveness and empowerment across social groups, particularly those at the margins of society; and identifies widely applicable solutions to engage in the transformation toward sustainable food systems. DEMETRA builds on a multidimensional approach that combines macro- (institutional), meso- (organizational), and micro-level (individual) explanatory factors; a cross-national comparative design that includes European countries with different DPPs experience and different food systems (Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, and UK); and an integrated methodological approach based on multiple sources and methods (including population surveys, organizational survey, semi-structured interviews, participant observation, and public policy analysis).

However, the profound psycho-emotional and existential distress entailed by such suffering, despite often being an enormous burden for both patients and their loved ones, remains a field largely overlooked by health care providers and the scientific community. Those people may develop mood or anxiety disorder for which neither non-pharmacological nor pharmacological interventions exist. In this context, we believe it is now time to target these unmet needs in the palliative care population. We want to initiate a paradigm shift at the boundaries between palliative care, psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, and spiritual care. Our starting point is the preliminary results being reported for administration of psilocybin, the main psychoactive compound of so-called ‘psychedelic mushrooms’, in patients with depression. The objective of our project is thus to examine the clinical effect of a cutting-edge, individualised and patient-centred, open and standardised Psilocybin Therapy, addressing these unmet needs of patients in palliative care. We will show high quality evidence via a multi-centre Randomised Clinical Trial of the value of our therapeutic model in patients (and for the following four conditions: COPD, Atypical Parkinsonian Disorders, ALS, and Multiple Sclerosis), their loved ones and care providers, in a diverse sample of the European population, in addition to better understand the mechanisms of therapeutic change of our model. Finally, our project will establish a sustainable, multi-disciplinary, ecosystem of key European stakeholders jointly contributing to the medical use of psychedelic research and innovation, paving the way towards an ethical and cost-effective deployment of such a new line of care for patients in European palliative care service providers.|10.3030/101137378|Cluster Health

FUTURHIST will rely on the identification and characterisation of local uniform building typologies, as a lowest common denominator, to develop tailored intervention approaches that can be standardised and replicated in all buildings of that category with minor modifications. The standardised approach will then serve as a basis for the adaptation to other typologies in the same context (climate, regulations, etc.) or even similar typologies (in terms of materials, configuration, etc.) in different contexts.Although considerable progress has been done in recent years in terms of development of materials and solutions compatible with conservation of historic buildings, several challenges remain still open. FUTURHIST will develop both passive and active solutions with a focus on an efficient use of energy and resources, improved wellbeing, enhanced durability, revalorization of existing materials and techniques, integration of renewable energy systems, and smart solutions for decarbonising heating, cooling, and ventilation. Mentioned here, just as examples, be a clay-biochar-insulation, self-healing lime plaster and hybrid original-vacuum glazing.Demonstration is at the core of the project. The solutions developed as well as the approach will be implemented and tested in four cases in Spain, Poland, Sweden, and the UK. The diversity and geographical distribution of the demo cases will ensure the validation under different climates, construction typologies and socio-economic environments. The demo case owners, as members of the consortium, will facilitate a rapid uptake of the results to be implemented in their large portfolios immediately after the completion of the project.

As is well established, the internet has become a focal point for modern extremist activities. What is less understood in a European context is the role masculinity plays in these online communities and platforms. More insight is also required into how extremist leaders use and perform masculinity to appeal to European men, and how, in turn, these men respond to these gender narratives and how this shapes their perception of democracy and the EU. To address this need for deeper, more critical understandings of these gendered phenomena, EMMELO focuses on six countries: Ireland, Sweden, France, Hungary, Germany and Slovakia, exploring how different forms of masculinity are used by extremist movements and their leadership to appeal to men and undermine traditional democratic participation and discourse in cross European contexts. The project explores how extremist movements construct, perform and circulate narratives of masculinity online, how these narratives shape the perspectives and gendered experiences of European men currently or formerly active in extremist online communities, and the wider implications of these trends for democratic processes and social cohesion, online and offline. From its activities, EMMELO will develop innovative, gender-sensitive tools and policy recommendations to enable policymakers, practitioners and citizens better understand and address the role of masculinity in modern European extremist movements. The project's findings will be targeted at key audiences in formats designed to raise awareness at the levels of policy, practice and citizen of the key role masculinity plays in extremism, including how to identify it, discuss it, and challenge it.|10.3030/101177204|Cluster 2

Deep structural biology studies on viral glycoproteins and investigation of the immunogenicity of the viral antigens will be combined with optimisation of an mRNA vaccine candidate against the virus and characterisation of the resulting protective immunity, as well as with the development of immunotherapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) based on CCHFV’s antigenic targets.To achieve the overarching goals, the CCHFVACIM project will build on the success of previous projects such as CCHFever (FP7), CCHFVaccine (H2020) and go the extra mile by initiating a unique One-Health platform strategy to address different aspects of this severe public health threat. On one hand, the project will use several advanced animal models (mice, sheep, and non-human primate) to assess and compare the efficacy of mRNA vaccine candidates, mAbs and therapeutic mRNA; on the other hand, it will establish a biobank from CCHF patients to build up a pipeline for the production of mAbs against CCHFV from their B cells.Importantly, the project will also contribute to capacity building of European infrastructures, with the establishment of a platform on mRNA-based vaccine at one of the partner institutions. Ultimately, CCHFVACIM will permit to develop a road map to bring the most efficacious vaccine candidates and immunotherapy tools to clinical trial Phase I in humans.

These applications require miniaturized low power and low-cost gas sensors with good gas selectivity to be integrated in personal devices, in product packaging or in widely distributed sensor networks.AMUSENS aims at developing a gas sensor platform with flexible selectivity to different gas environments by combining a multi-pixel approach and artificial intelligence to adapt the data analysis to the targeted applications. It is based on metal oxide sensing materials on micro-hotplate platform, which are already available on the market for low power applications, but suffer from a lack of selectivity. Gas-selective multi-pixel sensors based on different metal oxide materials have been demonstrated, but their industrialization is limited to few industrially available materials. By using original additive manufacturing approaches for local liquid-phase and gas-phase depositions, we aim at extending the choice of available materials and demonstrate their sustainability in wafer-scale processing. Artificial intelligence will be used both to accelerate the choice of materials and for data fusion to determine specific patterns in the gas analysis. Two specific applications targeting personal exposure and health care will demonstrate the adaptability of the platform, based on an analysis of the users' requirements.The proposed architecture will be adaptable to many applications (i) from the flexibility in choosing the materials, made possible by the local deposition techniques, and (ii) from the programming protocol of the artificial intelligence.

However, several European education systems are regularly pointed out as being underperforming, inequitable or segregated. The core objective of the 4-year MTSS-K project is to adapt, implement and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of a promising American educational approach for kindergarten in five European countries. The so-called Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) aims at reducing inequalities by training teachers to improve the socio-emotional, literacy and numeracy skills of all students and more particularly of the most vulnerable ones. This model calls to adopt evidence-based teaching practices and to regularly and monitor students’ progress on the basis of objective data (Tier 1); to provide early and more intensive group interventions to students who do not progress as expected (Tier 2); and to provide even more intensive interventions to students who continue to need it (Tier 3). This model has been shown to improve equal opportunities of school success and inclusion by significantly diminishing the number of students with learning and behavior difficulties and referred to special education services. However, data is missing as regards comprehensive implementation of this model, its efficacy in kindergarten, its applicability in the European educative systems, and the cost-benefit ratio of this measure. In addition to fill these gaps, the MTSS-K project also aims at making accessible for stakeholders, schools and teachers on a dedicated free-access website evidence-based syntheses, intervention tools, and skills’ assessment instruments developed for the study, to disseminate the results and data in the perspective of the open-science framework, and to make policy recommendations for EU and national authorities.|10.3030/101132586|Cluster 2

Cryogenic propellant combinations such as oxygen / methane offer higher specific impulses than storable combinations, but their low saturation temperatures raise additional challenges with respect to preventing their evaporation during long-term storage. While the ability to refuel craft with cryogenic propellants would allow for longer-term manned missions to Mars and the Moon, as well as aid in the improvement of in-space sustainability, preventing the evaporation of the propellants during the transfer process also poses challenges. As of today, neither long-term storage nor refuelling with cryogenic propellants has been demonstrated in-orbit. CRYSALIS will develop and mature the technologies needed for the management of cryogenic propellant for future space transportation and in-orbit servicing activities. This maturation will include performing a small-scale in-orbit demonstration to mature those whose performance can only be characterised in a microgravity environment. This will be a closed-system demonstrator flown on-board the Nyx capsule, which will aim to not only demonstrate the feasibility of such processes but will aim to improve the understanding of the behaviour of such propellants under microgravity, allowing for development of future systems. These technologies will aid in ensuring the independent access of the EU to space, in particular to manned and heavy missions beyond GEO and LEO, by supporting the development of a logistical network of craft, depots, and hubs, required for cis-lunar and future Martian missions.|10.3030/101135431|Cluster 4

However, EAF production of sheet steel is currently not a reality due to the effect of undesired residual elements in the scrap.The aim of CiSMA is to introduce scrap-based EAF steel products into mass-market sheet metal consumer goods with high-quality requirements, currently served with BOF steel (96 % of the market).First, by generating fundamental knowledge on how residual elements, and Copper in particular, interact with sheet Steel and its performance. This will be done combining state-of-the-art methodologies with specialized resources, such as Synchrotron, to design Steel grades and determine safe residual thresholds.Next, scrap as a raw material will be studied together with methodologies to improve its quality and maximize the use of low-quality scrap, through the use of techniques that separate undesired inclusions from the main stream of steel.Finally, by generating a toolbox of enabling technologies to introduce recycled sheet metal in the industry: 1) fast characterization tests for quality control, 2) online test methodologies that can be applied in the press floor, and 3) the development of Machine Learning-enhanced Finite Element Modelling and Digital Twin that allow adapting production processes to feedstock with high variability.These developments will be showcased in applying four steel compositions into two pilot trials for mass-market applications: automotive and white goods. These trials will ensure that the material and production route developed can be readily accepted by the market, demonstrate the developed toolset of enabling technologies, and quantify the environmental improvements achieved compare to the current product.|10.3030/101177798|Cluster 4

Climate change intensifies territorial risk and impacts severely on human migration and displacement, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Avoiding maladaptation associated to internal migration as well as to other adaptation actions which do not adopt a nexus approach (e.g. water-food-energy nexus) requires effective planning and management of migration hot spots. At the same time, it calls for more integrated strategies which simultaneously support sustainable development growth pathways and climate resilience development in the African context. ALBATROSS aims at addressing these challenges by delivering novel, innovative and decision making-relevant tools and knowledge which will support the adoption of feasible, effective, and sustainable need-based adaptation strategies into AF policies and programs. It will do that by co-creating climate services and tools which will enable the weighting of compound and cascading impacts (benefits and threats) on ecosystem health, food security, socio-economic vulnerability while addressing specific natural hazards (e.g., drought or flood) or sectoral climate adaptation needs (e.g., agriculture) through nature-based solutions (NBS) and other climate adaptation measures. The methodological approach of ALBATROSS will be tested ad validated in different Sub-Saharan countries, leading to the co-creation and co-evaluation with key stakeholders of need-based adaptions options and plans. By combining participatory approaches with fundamental research grounded on the latest generation of observational data and modelling techniques, ALBATROSS will provide robust and science-based evidence on the degree at which NBS may perform as multifunctional adaptation strategy for counteracting forced migration, biodiversity loss and hydrometeorological risk in Sub-Saharan Africa.|10.3030/101137895|Cluster 5

This is achieved by developing a scaling infrastructure, including policy roadmaps and an actionable Compass for scaling democratic innovations, based on a Grounded Theory of Scaling. SCALEDEM helps researchers, practitioners, and policymakers assess opportunities and barriers for scaling democratic innovations along four dimensions: scaling high (impacting laws and policy), out (impacting greater more and new people), deep (impacting cultures and identities) and in (impacting processes' quality). SCALEDEM starts by analysing innovative solutions developed in R&I projects on the issue of citizen participation and engagement in democratic governance, in particular Horizon projects whose end date is after January 2023, to develop a Theory of Scaling. Following a collaborative and interdisciplinary translation process in its Translation Hub, SCALEDEM deploys two ambitious Scaling Grounds in the forms of Twinning and Pilot Programmes. The Scaling Grounds test and encourage the uptake of democratic innovations by new end users, scaling the societal impact of those solutions further. SCALEDEM establishes iterative feedback and capacity-building mechanisms to support the replicability and adaptability of solutions in new operational environments and actionability of theoretical solutions. In parallel, SCALEDEM involves and nurtures a global community of end users. It leverages strategic partnerships with relevant R&I projects, initiatives, and networks, notably the Network for innovative solutions for the future of democracy, to overcome the fragmentation of knowledge, identify opportunities to increase synergies for capacity-building actions to policymakers, practitioners and researchers, and expand the societal and political impact of EU-funded research in the EU and countries from Global Europe.|10.3030/101178637|Cluster 2

The normative stance of MORES is that both under- and overemotionalisation of politics should be avoided. The former leads to the affective disconnect of citizens from politics, while the latter spurs tribal politics and hampers deliberation – both extremes threaten democracy.MORES argues that moral emotions and moralised political identities – a conceptual innovation of the project – have a practical value in dealing with the challenges of affective politics. Moral emotions are linked to the interests or welfare of society or at least of persons other than the subject itself. They can unite people towards common causes or split them along moralised political identities. MORES applies a horizontally wide research logic to build a normative-analytical framework to inform democratic decision-making on how moral emotions should interact with values, policies and political practices. MORES will create state-of-the-art methods and generate new empirical data on (1) the type of moral emotions triggered by political actions and phenomena such as campaigns, leadership styles and illiberal politics; (2) the role of moral emotions in forging moralised political identities; (3) the effect of moral emotions on political behaviour such as policy support and civic activism; and (4) the contextual social phenomena, including digital universes, of the moral emotions-politics nexus.Through research engagement with key stakeholders, MORES will create several innovative tools including a method for policymakers to measure the emotional valence of policies, games to strengthen citizens’ political-emotional resilience both in real-life and metaverses, and policy ideas to embed citizens’ moral-emotional needs in policymaking towards bolstering trust in democratic governance.|10.3030/101132601|Cluster 2

Key parameters of the eruptions will be determined and their interrelations examined to improve our understanding on how the eruptive phenomena are linked, how they interact with each other, and how they result in acceleration of high energy particles and their release from the solar corona into interplanetary space. Large-amplitude coronal waves and shocks related to these events as well as magnetic connections of the radiation sources with the in-situ observers will be in focus as well.SOLER will answer three science questions:– What are the magnetic connections between EM radiation sources in the low corona and in the high corona and how are they connected to the particle radiation observed in situ?– What is the relation of the properties of the in-situ SEP observations with the source characteristics and between the source characteristics themselves? – What are the reasons for the large variations in SEP properties and associated flare and CME characteristics?Related to these scientific questions, SOLER has also technical objectives.

In fact, valid sources are even “hiding in plain sight”, yet not “within reach” due to lack of effective technical solutions to unlock their potential. In this context, the PROSPLIGN consortium has developed an innovative bioprospecting approach that uses cutting-edge and complementary chemical and enzymatic methods, supported by statistical analysis and coupled with high-throughput detection methods, to enable the discovery of bioactive molecules from lignin, one of the fractions of the most abundant biopolymer on Earth (lignocellulose). Lignin “chemical biodiversity” will enable PROSPLIGN to cover three target markets (pharmaceuticals, cosmetics and fragrances) with a combined market of >€1.4 trillion. The project will use lignin derived from 9 different species and investigate at least 3 different chemical approaches and 10 different enzymes to obtain up to 1000 mixtures of lignin-derived compounds, and then pass a progressively narrower “hit validation funnel” in industrially relevant environments, being screened via up to 17 different bioactivity assays. Sustainable production routes for at least 2 of the most promising compounds per sector, directly or following derivatisation, will be proposed. Compared to traditional approaches, PROSPLIGN's bioprospecting avoids animal cruelty, expensive exploration efforts (no novel animal/plants discovery), disruptive extractions (seeking “hidden gems” in an abundant but underexploited “biomass mine”), and directly targets the liberation of readily testable bio/chemical-functionality present in plant material, superior to other approaches relying on “manipulation-intensive” microbial strain culture or “extrapolation” from DNA/RNA). Ultimately, PROSPLIGN will contribute to a new generation of biobased bioactives, unlocking more value from existing sources whose immense potential has yet to be harnessed.|10.3030/101135298|Cluster 6

However, at the same time, eutrophication could be the potential solution to the depletion of global phosphate (P) reserves, threatening global food security. A vast amount of P and other nutrients are lost from the catchment and transported into lakes, making most lakes a nutrient-rich reserve, as observed by the frequent occurrence of massive, devastating algal blooms in many lakes. FERRO bridges the nutrient enrichment problem to the depletion of P problem to create a sustainable solution to both challenges by circular management. We will develop a next-generation lake restoration approach by combining targeted restoration techniques with nutrient recovery and recycling to achieve multi-benefits: improved ecological status of lakes, support a circular economy, climate adaptation, support food production, promote biodiversity, and boost ecosystem services provision. The multiple environmental and socio-economic co-benefits extend beyond the scale of intervention, supporting wider sustainability and accounting for social and economic ambitions.FERRO supports the natural recovery of lakes (after many years of nutrient enrichment) through four transdisciplinary pillars: 1) classification and prioritization of lakes for restoration (integrated in-situ and remote sensing-based techniques); 2) implementation of sustainable catchment-oriented solutions (biotechnology to prevent nutrient losses in agriculture and nutrient recovery at lake inflows and reuse in agriculture), 3) implementation of sustainable in-lake restoration solutions (nutrient recovery from lakes and reuse in agriculture); and 4) knowledge transfer.

Causality is addressed by a multidisciplinary, multi-layer approach, using in-vitro and in-vivo models, unique human samples, and artificial intelligence to identify mechanisms and related biomarkers, asking 3 key questions:1. Why are only insulin-producing β-cells destroyed by EVs? Weak β-cell antiviral responses and high expression of EV entry receptors may favour EV persistence. This hypothesis is addressed using human cell models (stem-cell-derived β/α-cells, organoids, their genetic modifications, anti-EV T-cells) and pancreas tissues from T1D patients.2. Why do only some individuals develop T1D after EV infection? Weak EV immunity may predispose to virus spreading to pancreas, persistence and local inflammation, triggering autoimmunity. This hypothesis is addressed by analysing adaptive and innate immune responses to EVs, correlating these with gene polymorphisms and EV persistence in children followed from birth and who developed T1D.3. How can EV-associated T1D risk be attenuated? By using vaccines inducing protective immunity and antiviral drugs eradicating persistent infection. This hypothesis is addressed by examining samples from pioneering EV vaccine and T1D antiviral trials to develop biomarkers of vaccine- vs infection-induced immunity as surrogates of vaccine efficacy; by studying whether vaccine-induced antibodies prevent EV-induced diabetes in mice; by correlating antiviral treatment with EV clearance and immunity to identify biomarkers for EV eradication and patient selection.The final goal is to identify individuals at risk for EV-induced T1D as targets for early interventions. These outcomes may also facilitate progress in other NCDs extending impact.

To tackle this, the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 aims to increase the prevalence of LF to 10% of the agricultural area, but there are several technical, administrative, economic and social barriers to achieve this. The overall goal of LAFERIA is to identify the key factors that can promote the reintroduction of LF in intensive agricultural areas, and develop strategies to overcome key barriers to achieving the EU objective. Specific objectives include: (i) Quantify LF coverage and connectivity across different agricultural systems; (ii) Establish a comprehensive picture of the benefits and costs of LF for biodiversity, ES, climate change adaptation, yields, incomes, and society at large; (iii) Explore the drivers and challenges for the reintroduction of LF; (iv) Develop strategies and business models to reintroduce LF. The research plan is organised around three major thematic blocks: A first block focuses on environmental sciences, and addresses the current prevalence of LF across distinct agricultural systems in the EU, their importance for ecological connectivity, and their potential for biodiversity and ecosystem benefits. A second block builds on social sciences, and focuses on the key factors which may lead to the reintroduction of LF in areas of intensive agriculture, through a co-learning process with stakeholders, analysing factors of success and failure in existing initiatives, complemented with detailed research at regional (case study) level. In a final block we will translate the results into the design and development of strategies, encompassing the identification of priority regions and agricultural systems to reintroduce LF, the maximisation of the biodiversity and ES potential from LF, and the development of policy tools, business models and market-based solutions taking advantage of LF.|10.3030/101181492|Cluster 6

We propose to follow the pathway outlined foA complex array of interrelated problems arising from climate change and biodiversity loss pose significant health risks, both today and in the future . Future risks from climate change are currently predicted to escalate (beyond planetary boundaries) and pass critical tipping points with irreversible changes to our climate with commensurate negative impacts on health, our ecosystems and our landscapes . Global, European and national policy frameworks have emerged in recent years to address this challenge, with a range of initiatives to promote mitigation, adaptation and resilience. Nature-based solutions (NBS),  or actions to protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural and modified ecosystems that address societal challenges effectively and adaptively, simultaneously benefiting people and nature, are among the strategies that have emerged to reverse the degradation of nature, notably in urban areas where changes are amplified. In cities, vulnerability to climate change and environmental degradation is high due to dense populations, critical infrastructure, and at-risk communities (e.g. vast differences across social-economic gradient). Cities offer an opportunity to accelerate the implementation of current solutions aligned with emerging strategies and policy initiatives (e.g. New European Bauhaus, 100 Climate Neutral and Smart Cities) combining to form what is termed a just green transition. This refers to a process of far-reaching sociotechnical change leading to a green and climate-neutral economy that preserves biodiversity and ensures social justice.

There is a long legacy of various definitions of a social contract in political theory. There is also a long historical legacy of practiced social contracts, in countries inside and outside the European union. To grasp the impact of the social contract between  individuals and groups as well as between the demos and the state across societies, it is crucial to understand the concept in plural and analyse how definitions and practises shape also the scope, implications, and resilience of social contracts in the face of societal transformations. This requires a high-level of context sensitivity and ability to shift between local, regional, national, and transnational settings. Based on the analyses of the limitations of, and challenges to the social contracts in political theorising and practices, CO3 aims at developing and promoting a more democratic, more inclusive and more open model of social contracts, which manifest political and social resilience in the face of major societal challenges, crises, and anti-democratic tendencies.

UNIC’s objectives are to improve non-CO2 emission measurements, including nitrogen oxides and volatile and non-volatile particulate matter,  across all flight phases. This will improve the understanding of the impact of alternative fuels (SAF and H2) on non-CO2 aged emissions and refine aerosol-cloud interaction models whilst providing robust data to support future aviation policy decisions.To achieve these objectives, UNIC will develop and enhance novel technologies including a cold oxidation flow reactor and an integrated on-board sensor for real-time CO2 and non-CO2 emission quantification across the entire flight envelope, including cruise. UNIC will conduct extensive laboratory, combustor, engine and flight tests using both conventional and alternative fuels. These extensive tests will go beyond certification testing to provide a comprehensive assessment of pollutantes that impact climate. They will include particle size distributions down to 1 nm , gas- and particle-phase chemical composition, charged particle/ion concentration and ice nucleation potential of emissions, including those of lubrication oil. The project will leverage advanced modelling techniques to simulate the interactions of emissions with clouds to improve assessment of their radiative forcing impact more accurately.UNIC aligns with the Horizon work programme by addressing urgent needs in aviation emission science and regulation, providing data that supports the development of effective emission reduction strategies.

Existing socio-economic and gendered inequalities in LTC might worsen in the future due to demographic ageing and austerity measures in LTC provision. So far, person-centered integrated care (PC-IC), as one solution to tackle these challenges, has mostly been developed in a top-down logic, and community engagement and participatory co-design have hardly been explored to develop PC-IC solutions. The aim of BUILD is to develop a framework and toolbox that assists policy makers in implementing participatory co-design and community engagement as methods to develop socially inclusive and sustainable PC-IC solutions for older adults with complex care needs that can be evaluated by the social return on investment. BUILD will increase the understanding of PC-IC by mapping and analyzing existing eco-systems of IC across Europe and identifying their corresponding regulatory frameworks and current challenges. BUILD will then go beyond these challenges by conducting a longitudinal, cross-national study that investigates care integration on a practical level, developing scientific evidence on how social inequalities shape the access to, and the outcomes of diverse forms of care and their integration while also highlighting the needs and required skills for PC-IC from the patients’ and caregivers’ perspective. Throughout the project, BUILD will involve communities, older adults with complex care needs, in-/formal caregivers, stakeholders and policy makers on different regulatory levels in the participatory co-design of PC-IC solutions and develop policy recommendations based on the experiences gathered. Ultimately, BUILD will develop a co-design framework and toolbox, as the main outcome of the project, that supports the implementation of PC-IC through co-design and community engagement.|10.3030/101132365|Cluster 2

On the other hand, they are often accused of being cosmetic solutions to deep-seated problems that continue to exclude already disempowered groups (along socioeconomic, gender, racial, physical and mental ability lines). INSPIRE aims to tackle these accusations and failures by fostering intersectional equality, through participatory spaces that are: inclusive and start from the needs and assets of marginalised groups; resilient to changes in government and developing upon existing grassroots work to support community resilience; and embedded within the wider public sphere and in productive relationships with policymaking institutions (Bussu et al 2022a; Escobar 2022).We employ three key ideas: the political economy of participation, co-design, and assemblage theory. We place emphasis on socioeconomic factors that affect people’s capabilities to participate, or the political economy of participation. We use a range of arts-based, digital and creative methods to co-design with participants inclusive participatory spaces that move beyond just talk-centric deliberation, which can exacerbate existing inequalities. To analyse and foster intersectional equality within PDD we need to overcome the linearity and oversimplification that sometimes characterise methodological approaches in the field, which tend to overlook the dynamism, complexity, and messiness of participation. The concept of assemblage helps us look at how different participatory practices coexist, interact and change across local, national and transnational levels. Using these theoretical and analytical tools we can trace more clearly processes and power dynamics that exacerbate inequalities, and we can strengthen democratic and inclusive participation through its many forms and practices.|10.3030/101132292|Cluster 2

Based on this research, GAME-ER will formulate a series of policy and practical recommendations which will compose an Interactive Methodological Toolkit. These recommendations are aimed especially at local and national policy and decision-makers, with the intent to help them bootstrap Cultural and Creative Industries clusters, or strengthen existing clusters in their regions or cities.Much of existing research on video game clusters concentrate on clusters outside Europe, or on European clusters in capital or large metropolitan cities (such as Helsinki or Hamburg). However local and regional clusters also are key drivers of innovation, growth and cohesion and GAME-ER will fill the gap around the limited knowledge we have about them. To achieve its ambitious objective GAME-ER a core component will be a comparative analysis of six local and regional clusters in five European countries, which include France, the Czech Republic, Italy, Scotland and Portugal. These clusters have been selected because of their different levels of maturity, and their specificities such as the concentration of human creativity or companies. Moreover GAME-ER will conduct a Europe wide analysis of the spatial organization of the European video games industry/ecosystem, with focus on local and regional clusters. Through this research the project will formulate policy and practical recommendations using a participatory approach and working with policy makers and the industry. The project is organised in six Work Packages, with 3 dedicated to research clusters and one focusing on building the project Toolkit.

A key issue is the erosion of trust in democratic institutions and the parallel rise in belief in conspiracy theories. The latter undermine democratic procedures as well as citizen engagement and create harmful political identities by exploiting the inherent vulnerabilities of democracies: their openness and the ambiguity of decision-making processes. These identities block political discourse with authoritarian narratives and hinder effective political action, threatening democracies from within.TaCT-FoRSED closes a scientific gap regarding the interrelation between democracy, identity formation and conspiracy theories. Using existing research and collecting new data, the project plans to a) investigate the impact of conspiracy theories on the adoption of an anti-democratic group identity and, conversely, to explore concrete identity factors that strengthen or weaken resilience to conspiracy myths. Based on the realisation that the complexity of value-pluralistic democracies is the counterpart to any simplistic, authoritarian friend-foe thinking of conspiracy beliefs, democratic identity formation processes are also seen as an opportunity to effectively combat conspiracy narratives.TaCT-FoRSED will therefore b) address its key target group of multipliers in the educational fields and develop OER that specifically promote democratic self-efficacy to foster a counter-identity to any conspiracy mentality. These materials will be evaluated together with relevant institutions from different target groups. The project will thus improve the legitimacy of knowledge-producing institutions and political parties by supporting democratic participation. c) The findings made by TaCT-FoRSED will result in policy recommendations for political stakeholders and educators in order to make the gained solutions widely accessible.|10.3030/101178926|Cluster 2

There is a strong desire for global integration from the research community, including weather, climate, and air quality monitoring and modelling, and in particular from space agencies, since global networks of ground-based observations are an essential component complementing Earth Observation from space, providing calibration and validation of the remote sensing information collected by current and future satellite missions. The integration of the current ground-based networks, which may have different interests and priorities, requires cooperation and agreements at the global level, including engagement with relevant stakeholders. Their service provision is not limited to data services, but includes access to the measurement facilities, reference instruments, reference standards and laboratories, all of which are topics to be assessed in CARGO-ACT.  The specific objectives of CARGO-ACT are to, develop sustainable partnerships and decision making processes with relevant partners, demonstrate the benefits of converging interoperability and standards to stakeholders and the global research community, establish the mechanisms for providing  international access to distributed research infrastructures and develop a roadmap for upscaling towards an integrated global research infrastructure for aerosol, cloud and trace gases.|10.3030/101132093|Other

Solid iodine propellant has proven to be an enabling technology to consolidate electric propulsion (EP) in the SmallSat market. Nonetheless, its widespread diffusion is still hindered by issues related to the low maturity of this technology. In order to establish the groundwork for a future standardization and industrialization of iodine-based EP, a modular approach will be pursued in the frame of the BOOST project. Different EP building blocks suitable for different types of thrusters (Grid Ion Thruster GIT, Hall Effect Thruster HET) will be developed and assembled reaching TRL 5/6. A neutralizer based on an optimized RF cathode will be designed such as to be compatible with iodine propellant. A fluidic subsystem conceived for iodine propellant will be upgraded and adapted to the system. Moreover, a tank will be developed in optic of on-orbit servicing. In particular, a smart recharging system will be conceived with cartridges of solid propellant that can be stored into the tank during thruster operations. When the cartridge is completely exhausted it shall be extracted and substituted with a new one by a servicing spacecraft. Once every sub-system is completed and preliminary tested, the overall system shall be integrated for the final verifications. The outcomes of the BOOST project shall not only contribute to paving the way to a future standardization and industrialization of several electric propulsion building blocks but will also lead to a stronger space capacity in Europe, making it more attracting to the international stakeholders.|10.3030/101135216|Cluster 4

One of the animal groups that is most impacted by this, concerns  pollinators. Pollinators face multiple threats, but the spread of anthropogenic chemicals (i.e. pesticides) form a major potential driver of these threats. WildPosh is a multi-actor, transdisciplinary project whose overarching mission and ambition are to significantly improve the evaluation of risk to pesticide exposure of wild pollinators, and enhance the sustainable health of pollinators and pollination services in Europe. As chemical exposure varies geographically, across cropping systems, inside the crop system and among pollinators,  we will characterise exposure by doing fieldwork in 4 countries representing the four main climatic European regions, Mediterranean, Atlantic, Continental and Boreal climate in Germany, England, Estonia and Spain. We will also develop experiments in controlled conditions on different species of bees, syrphid flies, moths and butterflies, and collect in silico data on their traits and on toxicity of pesticides. With WildPosh, we aim to achieve the following objectives:1.Determining the real-world agrochemical exposure profile of wild pollinators at landscape level, within and among sites;2.Using integrated and controlled laboratory and semi-field experiments to characterise causal relationships between pesticides and pollinator health;3.Building an open database on pollinator traits/distribution and chemicals to define exposure and toxicity scenarios by developing databases on ecological traits and the spatial distribution of pollinators in relation to their potential exposure to pesticide;4.Proposing integrated systems-based risk assessment tools for risk assessment for wild pollinators; and5.Driving policy and practice through interactive innovation, meeting the need for monitoring tools, novel and innovative screening protocols for practice and policymaker use.|10.3030/101135238|Cluster 6

In HABITRACK, we propose to deploy multiple-sensor tracking tags on migratory species, to tackle fine scale habitat needs of mature individuals for a variety of unsecured huntable migratory bird species, in order to provide appropriate recommendations for ongoing habitat management policies and adaptive management initiatives. The project will consider breeding habitats, first studying links between population trends and habitat use across the European range, and the projected impacts of ongoing climate change on demography, then modelling the response curves of individual use of landscape elements within a home range, to identify potential optimal values. We will also consider integrated migratory connectivity, to further link habitat needs on non-breeding grounds (wintering grounds and stopover site networks) to population trends, tackling potential carry-over effects on breeding performance. We will finally investigate the ways remote tracking data can bring new information on breeding status and performance, and on cryptic mortality, to allow the future remote monitoring of demographic parameters. Proofs of concept will be developed early in the project from species with already available large tracking data sets – a first obvious candidate is the Eurasian Curlew. Developments in the project will make use of already available data then focus on filling knowledge gaps in relation to the amount and quality of habitat. The efficiency of the pathways to impact will be achieved by the mobilization of various organizations and stakeholders in a steering committee, ensuring the dissemination and appropriation of the scientific outcomes and management recommendations.|10.3030/101135047|Cluster 6

The aim is to provide new quantitative knowledge of the mitigation potential of blue carbon in emerging coastal and oceanic habitats and to assess the scope for their inclusion in carbon accounting at national and international levels. Our approach is to study each step in the biological carbon flow from CO2-capture by primary producers, through transformations and intermediate storage, to long-term sequestration. We will do this by combining analyses of new and existing data at several Arctic and Antarctic Learning Sites and use this to develop and validate new ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms. These will then be used to provide large-scale assessments of changes in blue carbon habitat distributions and their CO2 capture and sequestration potential, both now and in the future. The new knowledge generated will be presented to the scientific community and to decision makers and managers as policy briefs to guide the designation of marine protected areas that recognize both diversity and blue carbon potential. The POMP consortium is highly qualified to meet this task with world-leading experts on blue carbon and climate change impacts in the polar regions, and partners that bring together scientific expertise, extensive unpublished data, polar infrastructure, and unique sampling opportunities as well as experience and resources from several national and EU projects directly related to this call.

This role is to enable frontier research for a sound understanding of ecosystem change or adaptation in response to multiple global change pressures/pulses, thus providing an essential tool for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and the Green Deal, and for the transition to a sustainable and resilient Europe.Given the current 'force majeure' factors, the RI cannot be implemented in the linear process originally planned, but in a phased approach that requires agile planning tools to support scenario assessment and prioritisation in close interaction with our stakeholders. To this end, EnRich is implementing a model-based systems engineering approach to better capture the complexity of the distributed RI and to support dynamic decision making towards a research infrastructure capacity that is well co-ordinated across ~20 formally involved countries. The eLTER System Architecture (SA) allows us to design a baseline 'Skeleton RI' with well selected initial key services as a starting point for incremental extensions during the operational phase. Cyberinfrastructure components of highest relevance for the eLTER service portfolio will be driven from the SA and implemented in close collaboration with related projects and RIs. Formalisation efforts will be intensified to achieve sustainable commitment from service hosts and future ERIC members, despite the current global uncertainties. This will ensure a seamless transition from eLTER projects to eLTER ERIC operations, build capacity in terms of expertise and human resources, and strengthen user involvement in the RI. EnRich will also ensure support for decision-making in the eLTER Interim Council beyond the duration of the eLTER Preparatory Phase Project.|10.3030/101131751|Other

Recent research suggests that intratumoral microbiota may contribute to anti-cancer drug resistance, in particular to immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, experimental approaches to address the role of microbiota in human cancers are lacking. Solution: Project ARTURO will ethically tackle this problem by using an innovative state-of-the-art 3D tumor-on-chip (ToC) model, as part of the emerging field of Micro-Physiological Systems (MPS). Plan: The role of patient-derived bacteria, and of their postbiotics and released extra-cellular vesicles, in tumor ecosystem behaviors and drug responses, will be deciphered by integrating clinical data, omics analysis, and novel ToC-based information (by live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics). The development of advanced computational methods to extract ToC-based information constitutes a major force and innovation in the field, with high potential to accelerate future applications of ToC technology in clinics. The focus will be on two frequent poorly-understood cancer subtypes: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC). End-users’ perspectives will be addressed using a co-design approach to develop ethically sound and evidence-based cancer-related innovation and health policies.Impact: ARTURO results are expected to lead to a deep understanding of processes underpinning tumor-host interactions, helping to conceive novel microbiota-based intervention strategies, in particular for NSCLC and ILC patients. ARTURO will take social, ethnical, cultural, and gender aspects into account, facilitating the translation of ARTURO's innovations to clinical practice and co-design of policies. Ultimately, the ARTURO impacts will be far-reaching, contributing to future developments in cancer precision medicine and diagnostics and to the EU Mission – Cancer."""|10.3030/101136464|Cluster MISS

This multidisciplinary project is carried out by a gender-diverse team, through a consortium including the space industry, SMEs and scientific institutes. It is led from Toulouse, France by Airbus Defence and Space. The SCARBOn system is based on a constellation of small greenhouse gases (GHG) monitoring satellites, flying an innovative miniaturised CO2/CH4 instrument (NanoCarb) together with a coregistered compact aerosol sensor (SPEXone). Together, they will deliver twice-daily accurate global measurements to monitor the diurnal variations of fossil CO2 emission.The objective of the SCARBOn project is to mature the technical and industrial definition of the NanoCarb instrument and of the SCARBOn constellation, targeting an operational system availability before the end of the decade. The design of the NanoCarb instrument will be upgraded and refined following the outcomes of the previous SCARBO study, and its performances will be carefully modelled. An instrument breadboard will provide valuable data during an airborne campaign, which will be used together with modelled data to verify the instrument design. This will allow raising the instrument TRL to at least 5, targeting 6 by the end of the project. Data processing at levels L1 to L4 will validate the concept capability to monitor GHG plumes from space. The constellation concept will also be refined in view of a possible short-term industrial implementation.SCARBOn’s daily CO2 and CH4 anthropogenic emissions monitoring data, based on novel European breakthrough technologies, will be a valuable contributor to the European Commission’s endeavour to fight climate change. As an upside, the monitoring data will foster the development of added-value services and will represent a state-of-the-art European alternative to the burgeoning non-European commercial initiatives.|10.3030/101135301|Cluster 4

Such practical approaches will in turn enhance what we call 'democratic literacy': i.e., the capacity among EU citizens and regulators to discern the anti-democratic implications of certain forms of hateful speech or disparaging humour . (2) To conduct fundamental research into humorous 'counter-speech,' which will allow DELIAH to develop and promote humour strategies that confront anti-democratic rhetoric, hate speech, and discriminatory content, thus establishing 'best practices' for using humour as a tool to counteract anti-democratic speech and thereby foster broader and more meaningful participation in democratic processes.DELIAH therefore recognizes humour's dual potential. First, DELIAH investigates how humour can be misused to support anti-democratic agendas and, in response, offers strategies to boost awareness, regulate content, and mitigate harm. Second, and simultaneously, DELIAH harnesses humour's positive role in countering such rhetoric, advocating for practices that encourage active and healthy democratic engagement. In sum, DELIAH is dedicated to exploring and establishing the delicate balance between humour's potential to harm and its capacity to heal in a democratic context, aiming to cultivate a more informed, resilient, and participatory democratic society in Europe.|10.3030/101177739|Cluster 2

It is not clear whether and under which conditions and governance arrangements experimental SRM research may be desirable for reducing uncertainties and lowering the probability of problematic outcomes including unilateral deployment elsewhere. Co-CREATE seeks to help structure this decision problem through co-creative scoping, analysis, and engagement for the development of principles and guidelines.  The project starts with a series of scoping notes that outline key dimensions of experimental SRM research including possible cases and their geographical, stake- and rightsholder, and regulatory implications, which ground the conceptual work. Co-CREATE then analyses and develops decision-support tools by asking what we can learn from governance analogues, and how various (risk) evaluation frameworks may help identify key characteristics of research proposals. Co-CREATE furthermore analyses possible legal and procedural conditions including appropriate participation. Co-CREATE itself will for the development of these governance elements enter an extensive stakeholder and rightsholder dialogue that validates preliminary analytical work, ensures stakeholders’ diverse dimensions of concern are included, and strengthens deliberative capacity. Co-CREATE proposes guidelines and principles to facilitate decision-making by the relevant authorities on broader categories of experimental research of SRM as well as case-by-case decisions. A draft will be discussed at a Co-CREATE hosted conference and later refined based on feedback received. Proposed principles and guidelines will be grounded in a understanding of scientific merit, physical and political dimensions of risk and risk-attenuation benefit, and consideration of broader sets of values and concerns – co-creatively identified during the project.|10.3030/101137642|Cluster 5

The tunable analog front-end (AFE) interface should be enabled at the fine-grain level by emerging reconfigurable field effect transistor (RFET) and negative differential resistance (NDR) transistor technologies that provide co-integration capabilities with European 22nm CMOS processing technologies allowing for a More-than-Moore sensor technology approach. Being doping-free these two key enabling technologies provide a high potential gain for a large variety of sensor system requiring a low 1/f noise behavior ranging from solid-state sensors, such as photodiodes, to environmental monitoring for the automotive market, and physiological signal monitoring, such as cancer detection. Having naturally un-gated channel areas, reconfigurable field effect transistors are the perfect target vehicle for functionalized surfaces, e.g. for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers, serving as a Reconfigurable Sensor Transducer (RST) for the healthcare sector. Together with the AFE, these transducers can be integrated into a CMOS as a use-case demonstration of the flexible platform.

Quantum technologies are expected to further push sensor’s performances, unlocking even more application domains, exploiting non-classical correlation of light and matter to extract the relevant information beyond the limit dictated by classical noise processes, improving performances such as sensitivity, specificity and uncertainty. The ability to produce, control and measure quantum states in transportable devices is the key to extend the sensors’ operating environment, lifetime, power consumption and costs. QUANTIFY fits perfectly this vision and the goal of Demonstrating quantum sensing beyond classical capabilities for real-world applications, in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Quantum Flagship Program. QUANTIFY objective consists in bringing photonic quantum enhanced sensors at the next level of integration developing the essential building blocks and novel quantum-enhanced techniques for future chip scale optical clocks, optically pumped magnetometers and optomechanical temperature sensors. QUANTIFY leverages different photonic platforms combined by a novel hybrid integration technique to bring the key optical and optomechanical functionalities on a single chip. To increase the clock and magnetometer performances, we introduce a photonic integrated squeezed light source, also becoming an important step for realizing a universal quantum computer based on photonics. Finally, we demonstrate a novel absolute temperature sensor with an extended detection range, from cryogenic to room temperature leveraging a nanoscale optomechanical approach coupling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom. All the free developed sensors will be assessed using metrological protocols and national primary standards in National metrological laboratories, to foster their feature exploitation in real application for end-users.|10.3030/101135931|Cluster 4

The EU has set ambitious climate goals, such as the Green Deal's target to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. But this challenge also involves deep social and cultural transformations. Within this context, the Cultural and Creative Industries (CCIs) play a crucial role in the climate transition by raising awareness, changing imaginaries and contributing to economic sustainability and innovation.However, CCIs, particularly small and medium-sized organisations, are vulnerable due to limited resources and fragmentation, emphasized by the negative consequences of climate change. They urgently require tested tools to enhance their capacity for rapid adaptation and making meaningful contributions to the climate transition.Cultural and Artistic Social Enterprises within CCIs, work in close proximity to citizens and cooperation with local actors, which makes them uniquely able to identify emerging social and environmental demands. Based on this citizen and creative-driven knowledge, they propose innovative and creative solutions, having a unique potential of influencing values and attitudes and inspiring blueprints within the sector and beyond.The EMCCINNO project (EMpowering CCIs to boost systemic INNOvation for sustainable climate transition) brings together the fields of CCIs, climate transition, and social enterprises.

An initial SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats) analysis of the galaxies group has revealed that it is strong and internationally relevant in the area of optical observational research in galaxies, but that, in order to remain competitive and increase its national and international impact, it needs to strengthen in the areas of numerical modelling, radio astronomy, the exploitation of the most modern observational surveys, as well as European proposal preparation and management. We therefore team up with three very important European partners, the University of Groningen (RUG) in particular for radio astronomy, the University of Durham (ICC) for numerical modelling, and the CNRS - Observatoire Astronomique de Strasbourg (ObAS) for exploitation of modern observational surveys. Each of these partners has a long history of world-leading excellence, performed by teams built around prize-winning scientists. We aim to perform joint research, develop strategies for increased competitiveness, and ensure sustainable improvements as well as lasting collaborations in world-class science.

Sepsis is a major global health challenge and a leading cause of death worldwide. Moreover, people surviving sepsis often suffer post-sepsis immunosuppression, a long-lasting state of immune dysfunction predisposing them to infections, autoimmune and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), and long-term reduced fitness. The molecular mechanisms driving post-sepsis immunosuppression remain largely elusive. Furthermore, predicting which patients will survive or develop immunosuppression is currently impossible.BEATsep will tackle this challenge by combining the expertise of physicians, clinician scientists and immunologists in top European institutions. We will, for the first time, longitudinally assess unique immunological and clinical parameters and combine them to: i) gain insight into the long-term immunological consequences of septic shock; ii) identify novel markers to identify patients at risk; and iii) unravel molecular mechanisms driving post-sepsis immunosuppression. We will also develop strategies to improve the stratification of acute sepsis survivors to identify patients with a higher risk of sepsis-associated NCDs and comorbidities.

In addition, the growing amount of air traffic means that many EU citizens are still exposed to high noise levels. Intensified research and innovation activities are therefore needed to reduce all aviation impacts and emissions (CO2 and non-CO2, noise, manufacturing) for the EU to reach its policy goals towards a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. One of the main levers to decrease CO2 emissions is to reduce the airframe structural weight. As an answer, FALCON’s ambition is to enhance the design capabilities of the European industrial aircraft sector, focusing on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena to improve the aerodynamic performances of aircraft (unsteady loads). Specifically, FALCON aims to develop high-performance, predictive and multi-disciplinary tools for FSI in aeronautics, in order to reduce the aeroacoustics and aeroelastic instabilities using multi-fidelity optimization. This will also benefit to specific noise emissions generated by flexible and mobile airframe structures when exposed to both low and high-speed fluid flows.To achieve its ambitious goal, FALCON assembles a unique interdisciplinary environment of fifteen public and private institutions and their affiliated entities (from renowned research institutions to SMEs and aircraft high-tier suppliers and integrators) to cover all the required scientific and know-how expertise. Building upon three industrial testcases and tight links with key European partnerships such as Clean Aviation, FALCON delineates a high-impact/low-risk proposal that will significantly contribute to the digital transformation of the European aircraft supply chain.|10.3030/101138305|Cluster 5

Based on their origin and formation mechanisms, VOCs can be markers in many industrial processes; in food production as quality markers, technological indicators, process contaminants; in plant phenotyping as botanical/geographical tracers, authenticity markers; and in crops storage as shelf-life indicators. VOCs also pose a range of hazards to human health and the environment. EVOQUE’s main objective is to develop a novel photonic-based sensory system with potential to outperform the current standards and to meet the challenging requirements of at-line, on-line & in-field needs of Agriculture, Food, Environmental Pollution monitoring and Industrial Emissions monitoring. EVOQUE will combine gas chromatography (GC), Quartz Enhanced Photo-Acoustic Spectroscopy (QEPAS), long wavelength quantum cascade lasers (QCLs) and mid-IR metasurfaces to produce a compact, easy to use, low cost, at-line and ultimately online, field deployable VOCs analyser that will have equivalent performance to the gold standard lab based GC-MS. EVOQUE will leverage GC’s separation of components from complex mixtures, and QEPAS’s high sensitivity, specificity and quantification. Unlike simpler GC detectors, QEPAS will provide molecular recognition based on the specific spectral features of single VOCs. The system measures the target compound even in presence of interferents, thus avoiding issues with poor repeatability of elution times and reducing the false positive rate relative to GC with non-specific detectors. Also, optical spectroscopy of many VOCs is hampered by absorption by atmospheric compounds at the wavelengths of interest or overlapping absorption features of related molecules; using the GC column, these compounds are separated and eluted from the column at different times, thus unleashing the potential of photonics for sensitive fast, non-destructive measurements of VOCs.|10.3030/101135764|Cluster 4

However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions.RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources. It will also provide an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This goal can only be achieved by combining the ESA’s Planck satellite maps (30-857GHz) with the unique low frequency experiments considered in this proposal: QUIJOTE (10-40 GHz), C-BASS (5 GHz) and S-PASS (2.3 GHz), by counting within the consortium with experts on the previous data sets (including the teams responsible for QUIJOTE and C-BASS) and by using the most advanced analysis techniques.The combination of these datasets will provide high-level data products, that will range from more complete radio catalogues, including fainter sources and additional frequency coverage, to new component separated maps in wider regions of the sky. These new data products and models will be made available to the scientific community through widely-used platforms, increasing the scientific return and the impact of the project.

This development aims to reach the genuine optical performance for Lidar CO2/H2O monitoring from space and, for independency purpose, to use EU-only components/sub-systems. HALLOA will:1- Develop new EU industrial capabilities and reach EU independency for two key critical sub-systems of the hybrid laser: the 2,05 µm pulsed fiber amplifier and the high-power laser diode at 793 nm2- Space qualify to TRL6, the pulsed fiber amplifier at 2.05µm and the high-power laser pump diode at 793 nm3- Demonstrate experimentally that a complete hybrid laser system, built with EU-only components/sub-systems, can meet the space-mission requirements for Lidar CO2/H2O monitoring.Finally, HALLOA will provide a technical roadmap to establish a European supply chain for the 2µm hybrid-laser system for Lidar application, including a business plan for commercial exploitation of the pulsed fiber amplifier at 2µm and a strategy for space mission insertion.The project involves 6 entities, including 3 non-profit research entities (ONERA, LMD, LZH), 2 industry key-players (KEOPSYS, LPI) and 1 SME (ERDYN). It will pave the way for building a cutting-edge and competitive European supply-chain. The TRL6 demonstration of a hybrid laser system in the eye-safe region for Lidar CO2 measurements will represent a major step forward for EU technological independence in this domain.|10.3030/101189970|Cluster 4

The Ocean C Value Chain (VC) of observations, data QC & analysis delivers key information around this to decision makers such as the Conference of the Parties. The RIs play a pivotal role in the VC via their ability to operate at scale & pool resources to ensure common data standards and operational practices. The urgency of the climate crisis drives us to put this VC on a much more robust footing with the World Meteorological Organisation leading the planning of a Global Greenhouse Gas Watch (G3W) covering all components of the Earth System. Unfortunately the VC currently delivers estimates of Ocean C uptake much larger than those from models, leading to a damaged ability to manage climate change. However further work suggests that observations at a much higher density in the Southern Ocean (SO) would substantially resolve this issue. Our ability to deliver these via ships is limited by the small number that enter the SO and we therefore need many more observations from research vessels, citizen science platforms, autonomous robotic floats & surface platforms. This step change requires substantial technological innovation and complex data synthesis. TRICUSO will address these needs by a) improving the sensing technologies on floats and small uncrewed surface vessels, b) supporting citizen science on yachts and potentially cruise and expedition vessels, c) integrating biological observations into the work flow, d) improving data flows to scientists, e) evaluating the density of observations needed & f) proposing fit for purpose governance structures that allow the RIs to operate within the G3W. These actions will enable us to have a much firmer grip of how and why Ocean Carbon uptake varies and thus a much firmer evidence base on which to make decisions around managing climate change impacts.|10.3030/101188028|Other

MAGnituDe explores the consequences of mass migration caused by Russia’s invasion for European democracy and provides evidence-based strategies to reinvigorate democratic governance in response to the negative social consequences of the war for European societies. MAGnituDe utilises the feminist concept of affective geopolitics to analyse how geopolitical narratives and imaginations shape everyday human encounters through which social, political, and cultural identities get constructed and contested. The project explores human encounters on 3 levels: 1) migrant-state (between forcibly displaced people from Ukraine (FDPs) and street-level bureaucrats); 2) migrant-migrant (between FDPs and migrants from Belarus, Russia, and Syria), and 3) migrant-host societies (FDPs encounters with the material culture of host societies). To study the affective dimension of human encounters and identities and to suggest attuned political interventions fostering democratic participation in the sensitive context of the war, MAGnituDe develops and implements an innovative affect-centred methodological framework based on SensArticulate methods, encompassing art-based, experiential, and embodied techniques. MAGnituDe advances an innovative methodology for comprehensive analysis of the interrelations between social, cultural, and political identities, as well as the sense of belonging, and democracies (EO1), which will be used to formulate policy recommendations and pilot strategies preventing discrimination, alienation and marginalisation (EO2) and to diffuse antagonistic identities and social norms (EO3).|10.3030/101178269|Cluster 2

But how exactly does political corruption operate today? How deep can its negative impact on democracy go? And how can anti-corruption efforts recover people’s support for democracy as a regime and promote their engagement with integrity and their refusal of undemocratic proposals and actions? To address these crucial challenges for democracy, RESPOND proposes a novel interdisciplinary assessment of political corruption, seen here as conducts and acts, often proliferating in grey zones regarding legality, that results in decision-making bias and exclusion in the policy cycle. It does so by: 1) analyzing four contemporary and relevant forms of political influence (political finance, lobbying, revolving doors/personal ties and media capture) to understand when they become troubling forms of influences connected to specific political corruption patterns; hence, undermining fair competition and broad participation in political decision-making processes; 2) evaluating how political corruption is understood by political elites and citizens and is socially constructed through media and education, as well as its impacts on both democracy’s legitimacy and credibility and on responses to counter them; 3) exploring how established and emerging digital technologies entangle with political corruption and how they improve anti-corruption and pro-integrity strategies at both national and cross-border levels; 4) engaging in co-creation with relevant stakeholders to design, test, and revise practices and tools, including new risk indicators developed by RESPOND, to increase civic monitoring and integrity in current democracies. Through a mixed-method research design, RESPOND investigates 27 EU countries and 11 neighbouring countries to signal ways to make governments, public officials, and political parties perform better ethically and recover democracy’s popularity.|10.3030/101132405|Cluster 2

However, the complex phenomena at different length and time scales often limit the development of new magnetic materials and devices. The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modeling suite that will allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling, characterisation, and numerical optimisation. To achieve interoperability between software and analysis tools, we will establish a domain ontology for magnetic materials. We will collaborate with EU magnet industry to create standards for linking simulation software for magnetic materials from first principles simulations and micromagnetics to device level simulators. MaMMoS will use artificial intelligence (AI) to fuse modeling and characterization data. AI methods will identify and correct systematic errors in the simulation data, enabling more accurate predictions. Moreover, AI models can fill gaps where measurements are not available. AI models can also serve as a surrogate in multi-objective optimisation. Optimisation will guide further experiments or simulations, reducing the development time. In MaMMoS, we will apply this approach to speed up the development of permanent magnets with reduced critical elements for electric machines and to optimise the layout of magnetic field sensors for high linearity range. The MaMMoS software will be validated against benchmarks defined according to the industrial requirements for electric machine and sensor design. The multiscale magnetic materials modeling suite will be made open source to enable easy access to high-end simulation tools. Interoperability will facilitate data sharing and reuse among researchers and industries. Interpretable machine learning will reveal insights into the physics and chemistry of magnetic materials and guide the discovery of new materials for the European green deal.|10.3030/101135546|Cluster 4

With mutual benefit at the forefront, the lack of capacity innovation in the field of rechargeable batteries in Türkiye will be addressed through three main efforts: Research, Training and Network.This goal will be achieved by building collaboration with prominent European institutions, including CNRS from France- an internationally recognized laboratory (LRCS) focused on rechargeable batteries, HUB from Germany- an excellent research university that delivers top-level achievements in a wide variety of fields in both national and international comparisons, and in collaboration with industry partners of TIA- founded in 2017 for the development and commercialization of NIBs. Indeed, we are witnessing the rapid development of NIBs nowadays. Recently, both the first electric vehicle powered by sodium-ion cells and the commercial application of first-generation (Gen1) sodium-ion cells in a cordless drill were reported.  However, despite these wonderful developments in the NIBs field, a new generation of NIB still needs to be developed to reach the energy density of Li-ion batteries- TwinBat target to develop Gen2 NIBs to be closer to Li-ion (LFP) cells.While the research topic is timely and of immediate relevance, emerging economies like Türkiye must augment their capacity and competitiveness to match the EU's technological competence on this domain. Thus, increasing GTU's visibility and research capacity; enhancing the research profile of academics working in NIBs; and improving the proposal development, project management and IPR skills of administrative staff, will be achieved by investing in individuals and research - in this context, TwinBat is a perfect fit.|10.3030/101159770|Other

We do a systematic review of how these have been studied internationally using longitudinal designs. We map existing longitudinal data that we describe in a public metadata database, and we analyse them to describe the mechanisms of inequalities and to identify effective policies and interventions in different local contexts. We focus on the contextual differences between the Nordic and Central European countries that have structurally different education systems. Within national contexts and using comparative research designs, we look at system-, regional- and school-level policies and practices and individual-level factors (e.g. socioeconomic status, immigrant background, gender, special educational needs) that are associated with the development of educational inequalities and the successful prevention of achievement gaps. We publish and disseminate the empirical results of the project through multiple channels to scientific audiences, policy makers and the wider public. At the end, we create a public framework for studying educational inequalities longitudinally in future studies, acknowledging the role of local contexts but aiming for comparability at the European level. We implement the project in seven work packages. Our consortium consists of internationally acknowledged experts in large-scale educational assessment research from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Hungary and Luxembourg/Germany. The partners have a long-standing history of collaboration with each other, European researchers, and national and international education policy makers, and they bring extensive longitudinal datasets to the project.

So-called ‘adaptive’ workplace technologies try to manage these health risks by automating a wide range of architectural building services. However, there is severe lack of concrete evidence on how the short- and longer-term impact of such adaptive architectural technologies on health and wellbeing can be objectively measured, and then become benchmarked and optimized for a variety of hybrid workplace contexts.SONATA therefore aims to generate evidence-based recommendations on the use of architectural adaptation as technological intervention that can benefit human health and well-being in the workplace. Firstly, SONATA aims to measure, quantify and increase the range of health and well-being benefits of the separate and combined effects of state-of-the-art architectural adaptations on four different building shearing layers. Secondly, SONATA will generate empirical knowledge on how these multiple co-located adaptations can be intertwined together so that their health and wellbeing impact is greater than the sum of the separate layers. Lastly, SONATA investigates how these positive effects can become equitably negotiated between the varying - and often conflicting - work situations that must co-exist in a shared workplace. To ensure the resulting recommendations are feasible, easily adoptable and cost-effective to implement, SONATA will involve the pro-active participation and critical analysis from a well-considered selection of key target group representatives, such as workers, OSH-responsibilities, OEM and OHP experts, architects, workplace organisation innovators, adaptive technology manufacturers, and building certification consultants.|10.3030/101137507|Cluster Health

Although multilingual programs like Content and Language Integrated Learning can affect these attitudes, the large majority of these kind of programs also use English as target language, which does not increase the proficiency in other (foreign) languages. A second threat to the linguistic capital has to do with the protection of heritage languages, where we see that the linguistic capital of EU-citizens more and more includes non-EU languages. In schools, homelanguages are often rejected and usage of them is sometimes even punished, leading pupils who are ashamed of their linguistic capital and have a lower sense of belonging.  The increasing popularity of new technologies like ChatGPT and machine translation also threatens to acquisition of languages, as pupils do not feel the need to learn languages any more. At the same time, these new technologies offer many opportunities for teachers in their classrooms. All these treats can be managed via good evidence-based policies at different governance levels and by ensuring teachers receive sufficient training and inspiration on how to accept and stimulate the linguistic capital of pupils. This will be done in this project via intense collaboration with stakeholders at different levels, to ensure that sustainable guidelines, policies and practices can be implemented.|10.3030/101178914|Cluster 2

However, deploying hydrogen technologies needs a tremendous effort to complete the infrastructure, requiring efficient material assessment suites, enabling industries to be more effective in developing and working with materials. Furthermore, since hydrogen is stored and transported in several forms, the material assessment suites must be flexible and capable of revealing hydrogen-material interactions in various conditions.The HyWay suites contain 3 key modules: Physical realm, Virtual world, and Data and knowledge management platform (DKMP). The Physical realm will advance experimental capabilities to reveal hydrogen-material interactions by compiling characterisation methodologies across length scales. The Virtual world will develop a multiscale and multiphysics materials modelling framework for disclosing how hydrogen alters changes in advanced materials under various service conditions. The Physical realm and the Virtual world are interdependent and complement each other through the data exchange between modules. We will establish the DKMP to facilitate the data exchange and merge material research disciplines.HyWay will ensure the productive allocation of investments required in constructing the hydrogen infrastructure. We will strengthen European capability in steering green transition with digital technologies and future emerging enabling technologies and ensure an open strategic autonomy by supporting the transformation of the EU energy mix to be dominated by hydrogen. The consortium comprises renowned experts from academia and industries across the EU and will support Ukraine on its European path.|10.3030/101135374|Cluster 4

IMDs are characterized by abnormal immune responses, have limited therapeutic options and require lifelong treatment if not detected during the preclinical stage.EXPOSIM will provide a strong evidence base to better understand the impact of combined environmental stressors on immune health, with a focus on air pollution, noise and hazardous waste in urban areas. More specifically, we will investigate the impact of environmental stressors – the external exposome – on IMDs and immune health at different stages in life (pregnancy, childhood and adulthood). We will identify biological pathways and molecular mechanisms mediating the effect of combined exposures on IMDs. Through case studies and topical reviews, we will demonstrate the effectiveness of exposure-reducing and health-promoting interventions, with a focus on vulnerable and highly exposed individuals. This knowledge will be translated into policy recommendations and informed decision-support tools. Moreover, the project emphasises on scientific collaborations and stakeholder engagement, involving co-creation of health-promoting actions, education, training and communication. EXPOSIM will build a user-friendly toolbox for regional, national and EU policymakers, health professionals, researchers and citizens.   To reach its ambitious objectives, EXPOSIM brings together a geographically balanced, experienced interdisciplinary consortium (active in PARC, EXIMIOUS, EHEN, METEOR) of ten European partners with complementary expertise in exposome research, epidemiology, immunology, omics, novel data analytics, health economics and social sciences and humanities.

The differences among patients and the heterogeneous and plastic nature of each individual tumour have resulted in all therapeutic clinical trials failing during the past 20 years. Recently, immunotherapy has been showing great promise, but only in subsets of patients. Identifying those patients cannot be done a priori as biomarkers are still largely missing, nor are we able to follow-up on therapeutic efficacy when patients get treated. The GLIOMATCH project aims at improving the clinical outcome of GBM/pHGG patients by enabling immunology-based patient stratification to empower personalised matching of appropriate immunotherapy, while improving follow-up of clinical responses to existing/novel therapeutics. This will be achieved by integrating spatially resolved, multi-layered tissue maps (using integrated single-cell multiomics), with non-invasive MRI images. This integration will fuel into a novel MRI Radio-multiomics hub, that will be made available to clinical professionals through which they can perform tumour-host based patient stratification and personalised therapy matching while interpreting longitudinal follow-up and treatment efficacy. The proposed data-driven models will be developed by analysing the largest cohort of immuno-oncology (I/O) treated GBM/pHGG patients (n>300, including pre-post treatment samples) with matched controls (n>300) and exceptionally long-term surviving GBM patients (n~140), in which various tumour-host niches will be studied in how they respond to I/O perturbations and lead to improved clinical outcome. This will be empowered by deploying an UNCAN-compatible data lake, to which incremental data collection will be used to further refine the machine learning models, while proposing novel treatment options.

This traditional approach massively failed to manage viral outbreak during the COVID-19 pandemic because it lacked quick and cost-effective diagnosis. Moreover, an urgent need was evident for bringing quantitative lab-quality diagnosis to the hands of end users (i.e., point-of-care, POC). Despite high expectations from Lab-on-Chip technologies, they failed so far to disrupt the IVD market due to their complexity, high cost, off-chip sample preparation, poor scalability, to mention a few. The DECIPHER consortium aims to revolutionize the POC IVD field by developing innovative microfluidic-based DECIPHER patch capable of both biofluids (self-)sampling via hollow microneedles (HMNs) and immediate analysis of this sample on the very same patch in a completely self-powered manner, producing quantitative result to be read out with a re-purposed glucose meter. Ebola and Lassa viruses are selected as relevant model systems because they are highly contagious with human-to-human transmission, high mortality rate and no vaccine/treatment available, thus having meaningful potential for new pandemic threats. To offer such a genuine sample-to-result quantitative POC solution, the DECIPHER value chain, from lab to market, will cover: (1) investigation of high-throughput manufacturing processes with (2) novel polymers, innovations in the fields of (3) microfluidics, (4) HMNs and (5) quantitative molecular bioassays, (6) DECIPHER patch analytical and clinical validation (both retrospective and prospective), as well as (7) AI-based models, (8) socio-economic/systems analysis and (9) life cycle assessment of DECIPHER patch.

Climate change and urbanization have largely contributed to the dissemination of their mosquito vector and Europe has in recent years been regularly confronted with autochthonous cases. Few vaccines are licensed to prevent flavivirus disease, but the yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine has a unique track record of efficiency and safety. Intriguingly, despite its success, how YF17D induces immunity remains poorly understood. The YELLOW4FLAVI consortium aims to fill the gaps in our understanding of the mechanism of action of this vaccine by linking the structure of the viral particle to the resulting host immune response, in order to learn about optimal vaccine design for flaviviruses in general. Since social acceptance of vaccines is critical for their success, we will also develop optimal communication methods. This will provide us with the tools to tailor vaccine design not only to achieve optimal immune protection, but also to facilitate actual implementation.We are molecular and structural virologists, cell biologists, immunologists, computational scientists, clinicians, and social scientists assembled in a tight collaborative network. To pursue our goal of obtaining a blueprint for determinants of long-lasting immunity for flavivirus vaccine candidates, we will use cutting-edge technologies like cryo-EM, super resolution microscopy, spatial transcriptomics, high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, advanced cell engineering, small animal models, and clinical studies. In a unique manner, the consortium thereby follows a thread of events from the early response at the site of vaccine injection to the population perception of vaccination, harnessing an enhanced understanding of one of the most successful vaccines of mankind for the development of novel lines of defense against new and old threats.|10.3030/101137459|Cluster Health

Societal demand for FES will be complex, and highly dynamic. Some FES economic values are ill explored. Facing these challenges, INTERCEDE will help to better match future FES supply and demand from Europe’s forests. First, we will project theory-informed yet evidence-based scenarios for future FES supply and demand. Second, as recognized in the EU Forest Strategy, Market-Based Instruments (MBI) can be key in improving tailored incentives and incomes for forest owners to manage their forest for socially optimal FES provision. MBI can thus help aligning FES supply with multidimensional demand. We will comprehensively map and evaluate Europe’s current MBI landscape, adding new rigorous impact evaluations of Payments for Environmental Services (PES) schemes, while also assessing the EU’s Rural Development Programme (RDP) investments from a PES angle. From this, we will develop effective, adaptable and scalable MBI policies. We can only achieve this by systematically connecting research to policy and practice, creating our multi-actor aligned Transdisciplinary Forum as key interface. Our consortium brings together small and medium-sized enterprises assisting forest owners in FES management practices, organisations representing landowners and environmental interests, and researchers who excel in modelling and valuing FES, in the economics of instrument design, and in governance and policy analysis.

Geothermal energy can play a prominent role in this transition, providing heat in urban areas as an alternative to fossil fuels. However, its growth is hampered by the limited knowledge about the resources and risks in these challenging environments. Existing exploration methods are not suited for reservoir characterization in urban contexts. The URGENT project addresses this gap by providing sustainable and affordable solutions for urban seismic exploration of geothermal resources. Low-impact innovative technologies, consisting of an electric seismic source and novel MEMS based sensors integrated into autonomous nodes, will be designed, built, and tested on 3 sites: Balmatt (BE), Konin (PL), Batta (HU). They will enable high-quality data recording including low frequency signals resulting in high resolution imaging up to 4000m of depth. Ultimately, improved reservoir characterization will reduce the geological uncertainties and contribute to increase drilling success rate by 20%. Also, by optimizing survey design, including compressive sensing and simultaneous shooting, URGENT eventually aims at reducing exploration costs by 30%. For more efficient analysis of the acquired data, AI & ML methods will be developed and tested to assist and automate fault and fracture detection. Structural models including these features will be the basis for geomechanical modelling to assess fault reactivation and the corresponding seismic risk. In addition, ML techniques used in the O&G sector will be updated and combined with THM reservoir modelling to optimize the location and design of wells, maximizing heat extraction while minimizing seismic risk leading to increase plant lifetime up to 40 years and higher revenue. URGENT will contribute to accelerate the deployment of urban geothermal projects through exploration workflows suited for these environments, market uptake analysis and reinforced community acceptance.|10.3030/101147467|Cluster 5

We will target efficient resource management together with the recovery and utilization of squandered industrial waste heat and water. Together with ArcelorMittal Ghent’s ongoing initiatives, this will lead to a reduction of energy, water and raw materials by at least 20%.Thanks to the ongoing projects taking place within and around the Ghent site, the site is already well connected to many other industries like waste suppliers, chemical producers (ethanol offtake & H2 waste gas), renewable power producers, and wastewater treatment. It has become a multi-sectoral hub leading to efficient implementation of industrial symbiosis concepts. The Ghent site has a significant amount of recyclable energy, material and water that allows this symbiosis. These aspects are not only from the steel making processes, but also from other operations taking place in the mentioned “multi-sectoral” hub. This hub, can be further enhanced with the integration of waste heat with its ongoing initiatives.Our solution aims at developing and demonstrating novel heat recovery (heat exchanger) and upgrading (heat pumps) solutions from selected operations and then coupling it with the internal and external off takers by means of a heat grid. With digital tools, aspects like broadening the district heating network, and adapting the heat demand profile of the buildings to better match the intermittent of the waste heat can be optimized.  Finally, an integrated software tool for circular hubs that combines the different tools and data produced at the different operations will be developed and validated. Through two virtual demonstrations and a circular hubs blueprint the replication potential will be proven.

Collection of textile waste will become mandatory in EU member states by 2025.  Most of the textile are cotton, polyester, or their blends. Considerable amounts of CO/PES blends are disposed every year due to the technical challenge and/or economic viability of recycling.  The objective of PESCO-UP is to develop a sustainable and economically and technologically viable process of the mixed CO/PES textile waste to be upcycled into cotton originated and polyester products. The processes should enable for production of new products without quality restriction and of products with identical properties and performances as those produced using primary resources. The main tools to achieve this are the development of automated identification and sorting methods for textiles, Digital Product Passport with a marketplace-style dataspace for sharing data describing material streams to support matching of supply and demand of textile materials, and the process development of purification, separation technologies as well as the technologies that utilize the separated cotton and PES fractions for the valuable products.  PESCO-UP will ensure that sustainable fiber-to-fiber recycling becomes a reality in Europe. This will turn a societal waste problem into a business opportunity for European SMEs and bring the textile industry back to Europe. At the same time dependency on oil and cotton based raw materials will decrease, which will mean reduction in CO2 emission and reduced water consumption. The use of developed digital methods and digital product passport can be widened in other industrial sectors to solve their recycling and sustainability issues.|10.3030/101138367|Cluster 4

The risks and consequences of these emergencies reduce the health and well-being of Europe’s inhabitants. But their burdens are not evenly shouldered across all populations. Cities face huge challenges in preparing for and responding to disasters: urban publics not only suffer higher morbidity and mortality during such emergencies but resulting instability and response measures can exacerbate social and health inequalities. Vulnerable urban inhabitants are at risk during such crises for exclusion and heightened health consequences. With lower access to health information, resources, care and support, they tend to experience higher mortality and morbidity and longer-term reductions in health. The goal of Sonar-Cities is to render Europe’s cities more resilient in health emergencies and disasters through the co-creation and implementation of a community-based, adapted toolset for people facing vulnerabilities, first responders, and decisionmakers. By strengthening inclusivity in risk management, we will enhance preparedness and reduce risks posed by these emergencies. We will analyze One Health factors and consequences of past emergencies in 6 European cities, notably from the perspectives of people experiencing vulnerabilities. We use these analyses to co-create with publics at risk, first responders, and authorities a citizen-centered toolset, which will generate inclusive preparedness, improve health literacy and crisis communication, strengthen capacity and decision-making, and reduce risks of disasters/health emergencies in European cities. We will disseminate the toolset through our interactive Knowledge Platform and offer a Social Sciences Emergency Support network for authorities seeking social sciences assistance during health emergencies and disasters.|10.3030/101168315|Cluster 3

Fuels-C aims to contribute to this quest by increasing the availability of two liquid and two gaseous advanced biofuels for maritime and road transports, produced from biogenic organic wastes and CO2. Fuels-C will develop an integrated platform of innovative energy-efficient conversion technologies validated at TRL5 including bioelectrochemically assisted CH4 production, bioelectrochemical NH3 production, gasification, microbial electrosynthesis, and electroreduction. Various biogenic residues (biodegradable and non-biodegradable) will be converted under mild conditions into CH4, NH3, formic acid and ethanol, by two main production routes, using renewable energy, thereby enabling efficient energy surplus storage as chemicals. The 4 biofuels can be used as drop-in, but Fuels-C will also test them in FCs for electricity production: gaseous NH3 and CH4 in SOFCs, liquid ethanol and formic acid in DLFCs. Power density, energy efficiency and stability of each process will be validated. The technologies will be modelled at process level, for the description of interfacial phenomena, and at system level, leading to an integrated processes Digital Twin. This second model, together with a feedstocks mapping tool, will provide relevant data for circularity assessment, cost calculation, benchmarking and replication in other relevant use cases. This is expected to create new businesses opportunities and strengthen the EU's leadership in science and technology and in the biofuels market. Fuels-C gathers an interdisciplinary consortium composed of EU’s prominent RTOs and Universities, a large industry providing feedstocks and four SMEs contributing to market uptake and global outreach.

Transporting energy generated at large power stations over long distances to adistributed network of consumers. It is starting to show its shortcomings due to a rise in localgeneration with renewable energy sources and the essentially direct current (DC) nature of manymodern electric loads.Modern grids need to deal with two-way energy flows, local intermittent generation fromrenewables and local energy storage in stationary batteries. Medium voltage distribution microgridsusing DC instead of AC hold the promise to address the shortcomings of the AC main grid.There are several initiatives in low voltage secondary distribution grids, and DC-POWER is expandingtheir concepts into the medium voltage range. We propose the D 3 Bus, a bipolar DC bus operating at±1.5 kV. Compared to standard 3-phase 400V AC distribution the D 3 Bus can reduce distributionenergy losses by over 90%, reduce downtime, equipment cost, and space requirements whileincreasing sustainability.DC-POWER demonstrates, tests and validates the D 3 Bus concept in two operational pilots: Onepowering an industrial-scale hydrogen electrolyser stack at 2 MW power, and one powering a newdata centre with up to 500 kW installed IT power. Both pilots include sizeable solar PV arrays (200kW), while the data centre also includes a directly coupled DC UPS solution.In order to realise these pilots, DC-POWER develops several DC-DC converters, an AC activefrontend, as well as system protection components and a power/energy management system.The D 3 Bus is intended as a first stepping-stone towards standardization of MVDC distributionmicrogrids. It is such industry-wide standards that will enable and accelerate the adaptation of theelectricity distribution system towards the energy demands of the future and net zero.|10.3030/101135828|Cluster 5

There has been a vast scale up in the deployment of PV cells driven by the drastic price reduction of Si photovoltaics (Si-PVs). It is now widely accepted that increases in PV efficiency are key to pushing PV deployment further and continuing to lower costs. However, after decades of research and development, Si-PVs are approaching the theoretical limit for power conversion efficiencies (currently 26.8% out of a possible 29.4%) as determined by the Shockley-Queisser limit, due to thermalisation losses. There is currently no commercially deployed technology that can overcome this challenge.The project LEEMONS will make a proof-of-concept demonstration of a new technology – an electron multiplication phenomenon, which overcomes these fundamental thermalisation losses by converting high energy electrons into several lower energy electrons. This solution is compatible with 80% (possibly 95%) of current PV manufacturing capacity as well as future designs and hence requiring little change on the current manufacturing lines and therefore low capital expenses. LEEMONS project will produce prototypes fabricated from state-of the art European PV cells (PERC based and Heterojunction solar cells). These integrated cells shall demonstrate a gain in power conversion efficiency, thus opening up a new technological area, which will help deliver both economic, societal and environmental benefits.|10.3030/101172870|Cluster 5

The accuracy and mass conservation of the tracer transport model is of utmost importance in the design of the CO2MVS. Any unaccounted systematic errors in the tracer transport model can lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of CO2 and other tracer emissions. Therefore, CATRINE aims to improve the methods used to represent resolved tracer transport by the winds, with a particular focus on mass conservation, and to identify other systematic errors associated with unresolved processes represented by parametrizations. The project will define protocols for evaluating tracer transport models at both global and local scales. Test beds based on field campaign case studies will be developed, along with suitable metrics for tracer transport evaluation, utilising a range of tracers and observations at both global and local scales. These metrics will be employed in the operational CO2MVS to evaluate the implementation of new transport model developments, characterise transport accuracy and representativity in data assimilation, and provide a quality control stamp of tracer transport accuracy. Lastly, CATRINE will provide clear recommendations to the CO2MVS and the Carbon Cycle Community which works with atmospheric inversion models for the evaluation and quality assessment of tracer transport models.|10.3030/101135000|Cluster 4

However, secure crop production still depends on the widespread use of chemical pesticides, which is associated with negative impacts on the environment and human health. Diminishing use of so-called ‘candidates for substitution’ identified in Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 is of particular importance for combating harmful effects. SAGROPIA employs integrated pest management (IPM) to demonstrate substitution and reduction of chemical pesticides in the cultivation of potato and sugar beet. These row crops are prone to diseases such as early and late blight and cercospora leaf spot and to pests such as nematodes and the Colorado beetle. SAGROPIA will bring forward thirteen biological and low-risk pesticides from three company partners with the aim to replace several ‘candidates for substitution’ active substances , including the nematicide oxamyl and the fungicides difenoconazole, fluopicolide and metalaxyl. It also aims to reduce overall use of ‘candidates for substitution’ copper and insecticides pirimicarb, lambda-cyhalothrin and esfenvalerate by at least 50%. SAGROPIA’s approach combines several biocontrol solutions that, individually, have already proven activity on specialty crops and are close to market. SAGROPIA solutions are formulated, production is upscaled, and their mode of action is being studied. To grant affordability and ready acceptance by farmers, SAGROPIA envisions not simple replacement of chemical pesticides but incorporation of its solutions into innovative, comprehensive IPM strategies. Effectiveness will be demonstrated in participatory real life-trials performed in five potato and sugar beet growing European regions with active participation and engagement of farmers.

Dig4Bio aims to: i) advance the research capacity and profile of the coordinator IST (PT) in the field of digitalisation of biomanufacturing, and ii) strengthen the research management and administrative skills of IST. This will be achieved through a strategic alliance with experts in digital biotechnology from PROSYS, DTU (Chemical and Biochemical Engineering, DK) and lab automation TU Berlin (Chair of Bioprocess Engineering DE). Dig4Bio includes 6 Work Packages (WPs). WP1 (Advancing scientific capacity) and WP2 (Enhancing research management capacity) focus on stepping up the scientific and research management skills of IST through tailored training (workshops, training schools, digital tools, short term visits). In WP3 (Joint research activities), Dig4Bio partners will collaborate on a pioneering R&I initiative that addresses the question: “How to develop and incorporate a digitalisation framework in the conceptual design, research and development of biomanufacturing processes”. Attention is focused on Escherichia coli-based manufacturing of plasmid DNA, a biomolecule that is gaining increased relevance as a biological (e.g. DNA vaccination, in vivo gene therapy), and as a raw material in the manufacturing of gene/cell therapies (e.g. mRNA vaccines). WP4 (Clustering Activities) aims to foster close ties, synergies and knowledge exchange between the consortium and stakeholders, whereas WP5 (Communication and Dissemination) aims to disseminate findings and promote awareness of the field. WP6 (Coordination and Management) provides the necessary administrative support to ensure the successful and timely execution of all project components. The expected outcomes for Dig4Bio include the elevation of IST profile in digitalisation of biomanufacturing and in research management.|10.3030/101159993|Other

This CSS challenge gets operationalised through the development/implementation of two key R&I actions: 1) the Strategic Research and Innovation Plan (SRIP), and 2) the Safe and Sustainable by Design (SSbD) framework. Consistent with the aims of the Call HORIZON-CL4-2023-RESILIENCE-01-21 and  bearing in the mind the pressing need to develop new methods or improve current ones, to support the improvement of safety and sustainability assessments of chemicals, the project “IMPLEMENTING INNOVATIVE METHODS FOR SAFETY AND SUSTAINABILITY ASSESSMENTS OF CHEMICALS AND MATERIALS PARTICULARLY AT NANO LEVEL IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (CheMatSustain)” will not only study the quantum effects from a fundamental point-of-view (by DFT means) but also by identifying and measuring them through experimental techniques (high-resolution analysis, XPS and UPS), and determining the specific molecular recognition through their interaction with the environment, which is a quantum mechanical effect (in-vitro, microfluidic in-vitro, and in-vivo models and proteomics and transcriptomics and methods). The obtained information on these descriptors will then be integrated for the development of novel in silico models for prediction (eco)toxicity properties of advanced materials. Finally, in-silico model prediction results will be combined to develop a new methodology for the complementary use of Risk Assessment and LCA to improve criteria for the SSbD implementation framework. The work has been divided in eight work packages and the duration of the project is 48 months.|10.3030/101137990|Cluster 4

To ensure the success of this main objective, the TRANSEATION project counts on partners and collaborators with broad expertise in relevant areas covering four types of entities in the project (from research and technological centers to companies and offshore industrial operators) as follows: managerial (CMCC, IOW, GLP, CTN), industrial (SAITEC, ITASKORDA, GEOCORAIL, CCELL), scientifical (OE, UOH, CMCC, AZTI, GAIKER, IOW, DTU, CTN) and participatory (SO, ECOOCEAN, AZTI, CTN, CMCC). In addition, this project implements three user cases towards marine and coastal infrastructures, considering the different life cycle stages. Then, the following 5 specific objectives are identified:Specific objective 1. Apply EBM through a systema approach to integrate hybrid NbS in marine and coastal infrastructures to support the preservation and restoration of marine biodiversity and ecosystem services simultaneously with addressing multiple societal challenges (environmental, social and economic benefits).Specific objective 2. Demonstrate the effectiveness of [3] type of coastal and marine infrastructures as hybrid NbS both to preserve ecosystems and support their restoration considering its replicability and scaled-up.Specific objective 3.

This situation is particularly pressing in Northern Europe, where the conservation status of marine habitats in the Kattegat-Skagerrak region is consistently bad. MARHAB’s objective is to improve the conservation status of marine ecosystems by demonstrating an ecosystem dynamics approach to restoration and maintenance of protected habitats. By employing cutting edge technology (genomics, tracking, in situ observations, machine learning) in state-of-art ecosystem research, the project will provide the scientific underpinnings needed to bring about the long overdue reconciliation of fisheries management with biodiversity conservation. Moreover, it will generate a leap in knowledge urgently needed to sustainably manage the productive but severely overexploited ecosystems harboured in the Kattegat-Skagerrak Seas and adjoining coastal waters. MARHAB is urgent, timely and innovative. Urgent, because key habitats and species are in the worst environmental status of the European waters, while European citizens rely on a healthy ocean for climate resilience, and marine resources support livelihoods and food security. Timely, because international agreements such as the 2030 European Biodiversity strategy and the Global Biodiversity Framework (COP15) committed parties to reach important conservation targets in less than 7 years from now, including effectively protecting 30% of the ocean, and 10% with strict protection (in EU). And innovative, because this is a highly understudied region in what concerns marine protection effectiveness. MARHAB engages with the full range of relevant stakeholders at local, regional, national, international, EU and global level. Through a communication strategy tailored to target audiences, MARHAB will contribute to increasing the public and politicians’ understanding of marine biodiversity conservation.|10.3030/101135307|Cluster 6

With limited resources, these regions struggle to reach the critical mass needed to build comparative advantages and become knowledge societies. Though the European Research Area and the Framework programmes could compensate this marginalization through greater knowledge circulation, resources sharing and talents mobilities, the Outermost Regions present a limited participation in FP7 and Horizon 2020. This underutilization notably stems from the competing relations between structural funds (ESIF) and the framework programs or “substitution effect”: many organizations and individuals prioritize easily accessible ESIF, decide not to apply to the FP and end up in “substitution trap” which isolates them from promising collaborations. To move Outermost Regions’ R&I organizations and systems from substitution to synergies, REMORA ambitions to transform 3 Ocean and Marine ESIF-funded institutions in La Réunion, Madeira and the Azores into Horizon Europe champions : CITEB, OKEANOS and OOM. To that end, REMORA will enhance their competitiveness (notably human resources, knowledge transfer and innovation capacities), strategic positioning and connections with major EU networks through a joint internationalization strategy. REMORA will then use the successful transformation of these 3 role models to lead other ESIF-oriented R&I organizations and policy-makers in Outermost and Widening Regions on the path to synergies.|10.3030/101159246|Other

A dynamic passive controller involves the dynamic control of active energy, i.e. only damping forces. This has been shown to provide a significant increase in power capture relative to optimum linear damping without the requirement to provide additional reactive energy. The performance of this control strategy and associated technologies will be proven by applying it to the Wavepiston wave energy converter; however, it is expected to be equally suitable for a wide range of wave energy converters that utilise a hydraulic PTO. A numerical model of the system will be constructed and used to develop a control strategy designed to minimise the levelized cost of energy, rather than maximise power capture, which is a common, but sub-optimal, objective for many control strategies. The control strategy will first be calibrated and validated using a hardware-in-the-loop test programme and subsequently validated using the Wavepiston offshore test bench at PLOCAN. Two generations of the linear pump and controller valve will be fabricated, designed for mass production with consideration of its full lifecycle impacts (although the actual prototypes may use low volume techniques to limit project costs). The second generation prototypes will be based on learning from experiences and the performance of the first generation. A condition controller designed to increase the remaining useful life and thus reduce the LCOE will also be investigated. This will include identifying condition signatures that indicate a deterioration in one or more components and then using this signature to first estimate the remaining useful life followed by identification of modifications to the control strategy to extend the remaining useful life.|10.3030/101147456|Cluster 5

Three distinct European ecoregions (North Sea, Baltic Sea, and Western Mediterranean) have been strategically selected due to their different technologies, habitats, ecosystems, and sectorial conflicts with the development of offshore renewables. An Innovation Challenge Series will be developed to promote novel NiDs and NBS for each ecoregion's wind and floating solar structures (addressing issues such as design, material choice, noise, and laying cables). Each ecoregion will use a transdisciplinary approach to develop context-dependent metrics and impact assessment frameworks to evaluate the benefits and risks of selected NiDs for offshore wind. Moreover, data and monitoring requirements for evaluating the performance of NiDs will be identified to be later incorporated into recommendations towards standards. An evidence-based decision-support tool will be co-created with industry and managers to provide clarity on the selection process of NiDs in offshore wind farms.

Observations in the past decades have alerted for the rapid changes in land ice in this region. Record temperatures, melting ice and increased fresh water flux may destabilise the atmosphere and ocean circulation, with severe consequences for regional weather system, sea level rise, and affecting Europe and beyond. An improved understanding of trends and variability of ice evolution is important, and ICELINK will address this challenge by integrating Earth Observation data, in-situ observations and ice flow and climate models into an improved understanding of the processes that control the evolution of glaciers. Through improved understanding of snow, surface mass balance and the ice dynamical response to meltwater runoff, ICELINK will provide new knowledge of the response of Icelandic glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet to global warming and the impacts on climate and ecosystems. ICELINK will engage closely with local communities to co-develop and disseminate new knowledge, needed to support adaptation strategies, mitigate risks and enhance their resilience. A novel approach in ICELINK is to investigate the effect of increasing surface melting on ice evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet by using Icelandic glaciers as a data-observation laboratory for understanding the response in a warmer world with more melt. The improved models and new insights will feed into the World Climate Research Programme’s Cryosphere Project, IPCC, IPBES, assist development of Copernicus, and support the Destination Earth Initiative.

The application of fertilizers in synergistic combination with biostimulants provides the nutrients required for enhancing the crops yield, while pesticides are used to reduce the risk of loss from plant diseases and weeds on agricultural production. Today, the agricultural sector faces several challenges, namely:- Loss and leaching of fertilisers: Effectiveness of fertilisers must be enhanced through controlled delivery of nutrients ingredients to enhance their availability to the plants for longer periods. - Large amounts of pesticides used: It is necessary to reduce the use of pesticides, increase the selectivity and avoid pest resistance.- Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration: It is necessary to avoid soil and groundwater accumulation and bioconcentration in the flora and fauna.- Highly dependency of water availability: An increase of water use efficiency and water management is essential due to water risks.In this context, nano and biotechnology strategies have recently gained more interest in the agricultural sector compared to conventional agricultural techniques. AGRO4AGRI seeks to provide ground-breaking and Safe and Sustainable by Design solutions for plant nutrition and protection consisting of nano and biobased controlled delivery fertilisers and plant biostimulants, and target-specific biopesticides based on RNAi technology, both for enhanced agrochemicals use efficiency.

With the rise of modern technology, local digital twins – the digital representations of a functional territory combining low- and high-velocity data with dynamic models – play a significant role in PED development and the scaling of it, supporting decision makers and planners in taking informed decisions towards a sustainable future. However, focusing narrowly on energy and mobility topics confined to the traditional sectors, digital twins for PEDs currently lack representation of significant aspects such as social, economic, and environmental properties, and hence, draw only part of the picture of a district or a city. Limited by data availability and lacking awareness of existing data, this shortcoming in digital twin modelling for PEDs leads to suboptimal decisions, impacting negatively ambitious efforts of sustainable development in cities and communities. This becomes even more clear when reflecting on the scalability issues across the 80.000 municipalities in the EU27: As highly complex entities, cities and communities differ in their physical, social, economic and even cultural structures, making it challenging to replicate PEDs in a trivial way across Europe.The BIPED project demonstrates how to overcome these barriers in a simple yet highly efficient manner that works everywhere by answering three key questions to push PEDs to the next level: wide deployment.Three key questions needs to be addressed to push PEDs to the next level:•How can digital twins be extended to refine a district’s profile representation, guiding PED design and demonstrators?•How can the quantitative collection of soft data support the advancement in digital twin development?  •How to boost the replication potential of PED solutions for climate neutral cities with reinforced decision-makings|10.3030/101139060|Cluster MISS

Overall, at least 37% of Europe's freshwater fishes are threatened at a continental scale, and 39% are threatened at the EU level. This is one of the highest threat levels of any major taxonomic group (DG. Environment, 2011). Many species of river fish are in a very poor conservation status and even those that are protected by eg. the Habitats Directive, are not regularly monitored and documentation of the population trend and status is often lacking. A recent great increase in predation pressure has further increased pressure on river fish, even in healthy, restored or least-impacted areas. In the EU, predation may be the main reason for widespread loss of populations of Habitats Directive listed grayling (Thymallus thymallus). There is a genuine and widespread concern  among managers and stakeholders regarding protection of wild populations of river fish, as grayling, from unsustainable predation pressure. The conflicts involving fish protection and predation have been intense in most member states for decades and despite protective measures, including culling (Birds Directive article 9-derogations), the conflicts have remained intense. ProtectFish aim to investigate the monitoring and protective measures of Habitat Directive-listed river fish species, answering Area A of the call. We will develop and test protective actions, using cormorants (Phalocorax carbo sinensis) and grayling as a case. Small- and large scale field experiments will be conducted to measure the effect of relieving cormorant predation pressure on fish populations. We will examine the background for the conflicts, by estimating the current population status of cormorants and grayling in EU as well as quantify the culling of cormorants.

Sustain-a-bite food prototypes aim to diversify the use of plant ingredients in various forms, including liquids, semi-solids, and solids. This goes beyond addressing just the """"protein challenge,"""" as it utilizes the entire plant matrix to provide not only protein but also dietary fibre, essential minerals, antioxidants, and vitamins. This approach maximizes nutritional quality and offers associated health benefits. The minimal processing solutions developed in Sustain-a-bite will aim at tailoring the structural architecture of the raw materials towards reduced anti-nutritional factors, enhanced satiety, nutrient bio-accessibility, and sensory quality. We will evaluate the effect of processing on macro- and micronutrient bioavailability, protein, and starch digestibility as well as gut microbiome by developing improved realistic predictive in vitro models. Sustainability, health and economic impacts of minimal processing will be assessed both at the product and system scales."""|10.3030/101180399|Cluster 6

The marine environment is largely affected by global change and wild harvesting of marine bioresources does not represent a sustainable supply of these biomolecules. The main sources of the high-value biomolecules are corals, sponges, algae, involving industrial end-users in the medical and pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic sectors. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed in marine biotechnology as microbial engineering has not fully met the expectations for producing the marine bioactives identified in invertebrates and seaweeds. Recent advances in thesynthetic biology of terrestrial natural products are offering unique opportunities to supply bioactives of terrestrial origin.  Omics technologies have also transformed the way the complexity of the marine holobiont can be viewed and today the integration of omics data such as genomics and metabolomics can increase our understanding of the functioning and processes of living organisms including their metabolic pathways. COMBO will allow the transfer of knowledge from terrestrial to marine biotechnology through the engineering of marine metabolic pathways using Omics approaches. The rationale behind COMBO lies in the power of synthetic consortia of host cells and microbial cells based on the concept of holobiont and auxotrophy.  To this end, we will exploit the recent advances in co-cultures systems.  Indeed, the development of synthetic consortia has been shown to support specific ecological dynamics,  promote microbial species growth,  and syntheses of valuable chemicals.  COMBO will therefore expand the potential offered by underused marine sponges and seaweeds known to produce bioactives such as terpenoids and alkaloids for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical markets.|10.3030/101135438|Cluster 6

Floating offshore wind, with its tremendous potential, will play an important role in the future to achieve the European Commission’s ambitious goals towards a climate-neutral energy transition. However, the required expansion of floating offshore wind capacity to achieve, e.g., the EU’s SET Plan targets, challenges the goal to protect and preserve bio-diversity (habitats and species) in the EU sea basins as set forth, e.g., by the Mission Healthy oceans. The INF4INiTY project (INtegrated designs for Future Floating oFFshore wINd farm TechnologY) aims to support the solution of this challenge. By developing critical technologies for the offshore wind farm of the future which enable balancing human needs (clean energy) with nature’s and society’s demands (decreased negative environmental and social impact). In particular, INF4INiTY provides two major technology innovations: an innovative nature inclusive design for gravity anchors and their associated scour protection system and (2) an innovative primary artificial reef structure combined with the floating structure of a floating offshore wind turbine. To that end, INF4INiTY combines world class numerical modelling and experimental analysis expertise with leading industrial technology development. Being immersed in a holistic techno-environomic, multi-level, multi-objective optimisation framework, INF4INiTY’s technology development results in truly innovative, economically viable, and sustainable solutions for the current techno-socio-enviro-economic challenges of the floating offshore wind industry.|10.3030/101136087|Cluster 5

However, they also raise serious environmental and health concerns especially in applications that result in potential exposure to the body such as detergents, furniture, textile or food packaging. Therefore, this multidisciplinary EU project aims at developing renewable compounds as benign alternatives for current aromatic chemicals following the Safe and Sustainable-By-Design (SSbD) framework. The project will focus on the molecular design of novel biobased compounds as alternatives for substances of very high concern (SVHC) via an inventive catalytic biorefinery of biomass sides streams. New approach methodologies (NAMs) will be used for hazard assessment of the new chemicals in terms of human health and environmental toxicity. Machine learning models will be developed for the design phase and for the in-silico impact assessment of the novel chemicals. Successful products will be safe, follow the principles of green chemistry, demonstrate a lower carbon footprint than their petrochemical counterparts and will have a calculated life cycle and socio-economic impact. Formal SSbD reporting in RADAR will demonstrate the applicability of the framework and support EU policy. The selected RADAR chemicals will be upscaled to multi kg scale and investigated in industrial applications while they will be benchmarked against functional properties of standard flame retardant, surfactant or can coating materials. RADAR data will allow mapping of the substitution barriers in terms of supply, production cost and performance. To reach its goals, the RADAR consortium involves all relevant industrial actors along the value chain ranging from biomass refinery to chemicals production and brand owners in end markets supported by excellent knowledge institutions.|10.3030/101178148|Cluster 4

This threat is particularly significant for protected, endangered and threatened species (PETS), including marine mammals, seabirds, turtles and sensitive fish species, with their bycatch threatening marine ecosystem health. While bycatch of PETS is recognized as a significant issue, advances in fully understanding risks to PETS have been limited, due to current inability to effectively monitor wide ranging, highly mobile and cryptic species. There has been further lack in advancement in approaches to reduce such risks. These issues all hinder Member States ability to eliminate and significantly reduce bycatch. MarineBeacon will respond to these challenges, working across a regional seas scale to identifying where significant gaps in understanding lie, and adopt innovative approaches to produce the knowledge and tools to better understand bycatch risk and vulnerability. Next generation monitoring tools will be produced and developed to improve understanding of the distribution and abundance of PETS in addition to the levels in which they interact with fisheries. Cutting-edge mitigation tools and techniques will then be extensively tested across diverse fisheries and regions to ensure transferable outputs are generated to significantly mitigate against bycatch risk. MarineBeacon will facilitate the uptake and adoption of its targeted outputs by policy, management, and industry by adopting a stakeholder centered approach, engaging and collaborating with stakeholder throughout the project to producing best acceptable solutions. Importantly, MarineBeacon will ensure long-term applicability and impact of outputs beyond the lifetime of the project through the production of a suite of decision support tools to ensure all measures to better monitor PETS and mitigate against bycatch risk are effectively targeted.|10.3030/101135237|Cluster 6

For this, one of the current pathways is the massive electrification of industrial processes in demand for low-temperature heat (up to 150°C) thanks to heat pumps. However, the electricity distribution companies have recently issued an alert: the grid development is insufficient to match the enormous future needs for electricity. In the coming decades, this will thus trigger tensions on the power grid and lead to priorization in the supply of electricity. Therefore, to alleviate electricity demand while meeting industrial needs, it is crucial to provide alternative technology, such as Absorption Heat Transformer (AHT), which has the potential to meet the demand for low temperature heat, from non critical and abundant energy sources such as industrial waste heat, with hardly any electrical use.With this objective of offering another option than vapor compression heat pumps, the ZIMBA project aims to develop and validate at TRL4, an innovative AHT system at 15 kWth and 110°C. It will be based on a novel water ammonia AHT technology improved by a two-phase ejector specifically designed in order to stabilize its performance and widen the range of its operating conditions, in particular under hot conditions.From the physical evaluation results obtained, scaling studies up to 500 kWth will be carried out by the consortium, composed of researchers and industrial manufacturers, in order to push for a design with practically no critical raw materials, easily maintainable and recyclable, and with only commercially available components for fast time to market. The integration of the system in the potential future energy market and the associated business models will be studied in order to ensure a circularity of the energy and to fully exploit the exergy of the heat losses.Thus, ZIMBA will help the EU in reducing its dependence on fossil and electricity, while meeting climate goals.|10.3030/101146932|Cluster 5

To address these challenges, Manufacturing as a Service (MaaS) is introduced as a concept that utilizes existing resources in a value network by connecting manufacturers to service providers on demand through a connected network. The MAASive project aims to develop models of value networks that enable companies to recover from unforeseen external events by connecting to new services and reconfiguring value networks utilizing internal and external manufacturing services. MAASive will provide a toolkit for industry, which will consist of a blend of existing methods and technology applied in the MaaS context, and new models and technology developed as part of the project. Four distinct aspects are addressed in the MAASive project to increase resilience in value networks: network building, impact assessment, reorchestration of networks, and value network operation. The overall aim of MAASive is to increase value network resilience by enabling manufacturers to rapidly respond to unforeseen external events or sudden changes in supply or demand, utilizing manufacturing as a service.MAASive uses an iterative approach to develop technical solutions and identify potential technology risks early on. The project is focused on creating a toolkit from a human-centered perspective and involving professionals and workers in requirement and scenario definition. The iterative approach follows three loops focusing on 1) model foundations, 2) impact simulation and scenarios, and 3) network orchestration and operation. The results of MAASive will be developed in two use case demonstrators.The results of MAASive will contribute to companies being more resilient towards external, unforeseen events, by being able to utilize services in a value network better and faster, while also increasing utilization of network resources.|10.3030/101138040|Cluster 4

Wind turbine blades are made up of composite materials that allow lighter and longer blades with optimised aerodynamic shape, which boost the performance of wind energy. However, current wind blade composites exhibit relatively short life spans, are problematic to repair and are notoriously difficult to recycle. As we continue to build more wind farms these issues pose a major problem to achieving a truly sustainable European wind energy sector.The EOLIAN project will develop an innovative new smart wind turbine blade, manufactured from an infinitely recyclable circular platform chemistry, with in-mould electronics (recyclable sensors and heating actuators) that detect damage early before it becomes a major issue. EOLIAN is the breakthrough that will make obsolete single-use engineering resins in wind blade manufacture. Our unique blade is made using vitrimers, a new class of polymer combining the performance of thermosets with the processability and logistical benefits of thermoplastics. Vitrimer resins enable circularly recyclable composite structures (1), and the option of post-cure processing provides unprecedented manufacturing flexibility (2), but also repairability (3). These three features will provide a truly sustainable and step-change approach in how wind turbine blades are maintained, re-shaped for new applications and/or recycled in a circular economy.In the project we will validate these performance claims through the manufacture, testing and benchmarking of a smart sensor-assisted vitrimer-based composite 14m prototyped wind blade. Additionally, we will prove circular recyclability through the manufacture of 2nd generation composites with (i) recycled fibers and recycled vitrimer obtained after the chemical recycling by vacuum infusion; (ii) with composite parts produced by SMC (Sheet Mould Compound) following mechanical recycling.|10.3030/101147532|Cluster 5

To date, the majority of methanol is produced from fossil fuels (either natural gas or coal) with associated CO2 emissions of 0.3 Gt/year (about 10% of total chemical sector emissions). Biomass is a sustainable alternative to conventional hydrocarbon feedstocks. However, due to its high carbon and oxygen content, conventional second-generation biomass-to-methanol processes achieve 40-45% of carbon efficiency and result in venting most of the carbon back to the atmosphere as CO2.BeBOP is a 4-year project that aims to develop a novel versatile, disruptive, and multi-product biomass and power to methanol plant, that can transform the methanol industry. Thanks to the integration of an electrolysis cell within the syngas conditioning line, the BeBOP concept can double the methanol productivity ans achieve >95% of total carbon efficiency and recover high value components from biomass gasification residues.The BeBOP project will showcase a first-of-a-kind TRL6 pilot plant ready to be scaled-up and replicated by the European biomass-based industry. BeBOP will enhance market opportunities in the short to medium term bringing the methanol production costs below 250 €/t (with long-term low-cost renewable electricity and including 150 €/tCO2 carbon credits) and shifting the 10% of the production from fossil-based to BeBOP configuration allowing to avoid the emission of more than 30 Mt of CO2 per year (3% of CO2 emissions in chemical industry). Preserving the quality of the end product at competitive costs, decreasing the GHG emissions, decreasing the costs of methanol production and creating new direct and indirect jobs, BeBOP will have a decisive impact in increasing the circularity of the European chemical sector.|10.3030/101178117|Cluster 4

Nevertheless, most biofuels currently are made from food-related sources and have a negative impact on food production. The development of cost-effective solutions to minimize carbon waste and inhibit biogenic effluent gas emissions in sustainable biofuel production processes is still at an early stage of development. FLEXBY intends to go significantly boost this development by producing advanced biofuel through an innovative, cost-efficient process that will reach TRL5. At FLEXBY we will produce biofuel using biogenic waste from microalgae cultivated in domestic wastewater as well as the oily sludge from refineries.  This residual biomass will undergo a microwave pyrolysis treatment to produce three different fractions: bio-liquid, pyro-gas, and bio-char. The bio-liquid fraction will be converted to jet, diesel, and marine bio-fuels (heavy transport biofuels) through a versatile and innovative Hydrogen-free Hydrodeoxygenation. The gaseous fraction will be converted to bio-hydrogen through a steam-reforming water gas-shift process (WGS) and preferential CO oxidation (PrOx). Both liquid and gaseous biofuel will be tested and validated in fuel cells to produce electricity, along with an evaluation of their respective suitability for the transport sector. FLEXBY promotes a circular economy by recycling biomass residues and all sub-products obtained during the project.  The combined expertise of the industrially-driven consortium (formed by 1 LE, 4 SMEs, 2 universities, 1 non-profit association, and 2 RTOs) from 5 different countries will be able to achieve these objectives.

The electric energy demand based on distributed renewable sources is going to be even more important and a more efficient, secure, flexible and affordable energy distribution should be envisaged for the next future. If these requirements are not met, the replacement of well-established solutions based on fossil fuels will be unfeasible. Consequently, apart from the evident environmental impacts, collateral effects could occur, such as great blackouts at national and continental level. In this scenario, SAFEPOWER first explores and investigates on essential digital, enabling, and emerging technologies to achieve a new generation of power converters for solar applications: i) capable of anticipating failures to prevent downtime using effective Condition and Health Monitoring (C&HM) solutions assisted by AI strategies, ii) based on more compactly-packaged, efficient, rugged and affordable Silicon Carbide (SiC) power MOSFETs, diodes and solid-state DC breakers with a more sustainable manufacturing, and iii) prospecting on Ga2O3-based emerging power devices (MESFETs, diodes and solid-state DC breakers) especially designed for this application. Leveraging these technologies, SAFEPOWER studies and proposes new converter topologies and control schemes to enhance their compactness, sustainability, competitiveness, and security. Additionally, these technologies streamline cost-effective maintenance through AI-assisted intervention plans and AI-enabled """"limp mode"""" operation with derating strategies, which can be extended to offshore wind energy conversion. Therefore, the adoption of SAFEPOWER's technological solutions in the EU solar sector not only will establish a competitive advantage against non-EU power converter manufacturers, but also will enable their initial deployment within the EU."""|10.3030/101172940|Cluster 5

Accelerating particles to higher energies will always require a large amount of energy. In a society where energy sustainability is critical, keeping energy consumption as low as reasonable possible is an unavoidable challenge for both research infrastructures (RIs) and industry, which collectively operate over 40,000 accelerators. Based on state-of-the-art technology, the portfolio of current and future accelerator-driven RIs in Europe could develop to consume up to 1% of Germany's annual electricity demand. With the ambition to maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of European RIs and to enable Europe’s Green Deal, we propose to Innovate for Sustainable Accelerating Systems (iSAS) by establishing enhanced collaboration in the field to broaden, expedite and amplify the development and impact of novel energy-saving technologies to accelerate particles. For many frontier accelerators superconducting RF (SRF) systems are the enabling technology. iSAS will innovate those technologies that have been identified as being a common core of SRF accelerating systems and that have the largest leverage for energy savings to minimize the intrinsic energy consumption in all phases of operation. In the landscape of accelerator-driven RIs, solutions are being developed to reuse the waste heat produced, to develop energy-efficient magnets and to operate facilities on opportunistic schedules when energy is available. The iSAS project has a complementary focus on the energy efficiency of the SRF accelerating technologies. This will contribute to the vital transition to sustain the tremendous 20th century applications of the accelerator technology in a green and energy conscious 21st century.|10.3030/101131435|Other

SOLVE will tackle these challenges by deciphering the mechanisms of induction of long-lasting immunity and evaluating new vaccine platforms. To achieve this goal, an integrated plan has been developed including six pillars: 1) Vaccine discovery and design; 2) Head-to-head evaluation of the immune response and long-lasting immunity induced by four vaccine platforms in the preclinical setting; 3) Validation of the pre-clinical results in an experimental medicine trial (EMT); 4) Immune mechanisms of long-lasting immunity; 5) Data Science; 6) Determinants of population adherence to vaccination. New immunogens including key mutations from most recent variants in RBD and Nucleocapsid sequences highly conserved across Sarbecoviruses,  will be delivered through: antigen-targeting to dendritic cells (DC), i.e., CD40 DC-targeting, nanoparticles, a MVA vector and 2nd generations of mRNAs. SOLVE will evaluate in depth the immunogenicity of these vaccines in the preclinical setting, and in an EMT testing two vaccines, i.e., CD40 DC-targeting and MVA with available GMP clinical lots. SOLVE will benefit from the most advanced technologies to identify the mechanisms of long-lasting immunity. Integrative analyses of high throughput data, including from large cohorts, will provide insights for identification of factors (demographics, vaccines, immunity) which impact quality and longevity of immunity. SOLVE will investigate stakeholders’s perspective on the acceptability of large vaccination campaigns to improve implementation of next generation of vaccines in a preparedness track.

To achieve this, Euclid will observe over a third of the sky with high resolution imaging and spectroscopy, which will establish “the” reference map of the extra-galactic celestial sphere for decades to come. The giant archive produced will be a goldmine to study the history of the formation and growth of galaxies over the age of the Universe, driving answers to many fundamental science questions on the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, the interaction between stars, gas, and galactic nuclei in galaxies at cosmic noon, and excelling in the discovery of rare objects including gravitational lenses. However, the richest gold veins are also the most difficult to exploit: the tools developed for Euclid’s primary science will not be enough to open the rich legacy for the astronomical community. We therefore propose ELSA to explore new methodologies and create cutting-edge pipelines, tools and algorithms. Our ambitious goal is to push the boundaries of spectroscopic analysis to the limits, uncovering hidden details of even the faintest and rarest galaxies measured by Euclid. We will leverage state of the art machine learning to efficiently handle the high-dimensional data and reveal the underlying physical processes they encode. This will need dedicated computing resources and highly motivated researchers versed in the most advanced techniques, that will work with our team of leading experts in the field of galaxy evolution to reveal the treasures preserved in the Euclid vault. Our machine learning will be supplemented by citizen science, enormously extending the reach of ELSA’s impact.

This submarine cable and pipeline network is crucial for the European society and any failure or damage to it could potentially have an enormous effect on the societies. Due to the rapidly evolving threat and geopolitical landscape, especially with incidents like the sabotage of the Nord Stream 1 and 2 gas infrastructure, organizations overseeing critical infrastructure face significant challenges. They must handle intentional threats while also grappling with growing problems caused by accidental and natural factors as well as climate change. These issues can worsen the effects of deliberate actions. To address these challenges effectively, it is crucial for these entities to implement resilience-enhancing measures. The aim of VIGIMARE is to strengthen the resilience of Critical Infrastructure operators against threats to the European submarine critical infrastructure by developing, testing and evaluating an innovative solution to enhance security and reduce risks of physical and cyber-attacks on submarine cables and pipelines.This will be accomplished by 1) mapping submarine systems, surveying cables and landing stations, and assessing vulnerabilities in the European submarine critical infrastructure network, 2) develop an automated threat detection approach, creating a real-time shared awareness of the surface above the submarine infrastructure to promptly indicate incidents to both critical infrastructure owners and member states authorities. By integrating a comprehensive resilience ecosystem with real incidents at sea, the project seeks to 3) identify early warning signals, support analysis, and pinpoint potential response activities to address physical, cyber and hybrid threats. The result will be enhanced resilience for submarine critical infrastructure owners, supporting authorities to enforce the CER and NIS2 directives implementation in the EU member states.|10.3030/101168016|Cluster 3

There are many technologies available for converting waste heat into electricity but at industry scale the adaptation of these solutions is scarce. Specific barriers such as efficiency and cost of these renewable technologies and difficulty in integrating these systems in the production lines limit their extensive adoption as heat recovery technologies in the industry. Innovative approaches to improve the efficiency with new modular technology are therefore urgently required that can be retrofitted in production lines to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission. The primary goal of INFERNO is to develop a new hybrid platform system based on the integration of thermophotovoltaics (TPV), metasurface collector (MetaS) and thermoelectric generators (TEG), which will eventually contribute to a breakthrough in sustainable energy harvesting from industrial waste heat. We will develop new infrared sensitive low bandgap (<0.7 eV) TPV cell with integrated plasmonic metamaterials to increase the photon adsorption to improve the overall heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency to 25% and high performance TEG devices made of earth-abundant materials with an efficiency of 10%.

Its main objective is to develop a new high-speed ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) that will be designed and optimized for active antennas and digital beamforming.  Its performances will be validated on a dedicated demonstration board and in a specific use case. The final component will reach TRL7 and will be space-qualified. It responds to the challenges of the digital beamforming application by providing an integrated 8 channels devices with very low power that is able to make direct conversion up to the X-band. It will generate new knowledge on the possibility to move from the X-band to the Ka-band. The new ADC will be highly suitable for a wide range of applications, from telecommunications to Earth Observation and GNSS, and will respond to the future needs of Europe’s flagship programs, such as the Green Deal. The project addresses the issue of the critical components supply chain, by fully assessing the gaps and potential vulnerabilities, and will propose recommendations at the European and industrial levels. The project also focuses on two key elements, which are the wafer foundry and the circuit’s packaging. The ORION project targets a 90% European supply chain, as the manufacturing, test and qualification are already on European, open-to-all, industrial facilities. The ORION project is led by Teledyne e2v, and fosters cooperation between scientific (Fraunhofer IIS and the Polytechnical University of Madrid), and industrial teams (INDRA and THALES ALENIA SPACE). The partners will implement several measures for exploitation of the results and dissemination to the European scientific, industrial and policy communities. It builds upon and is complementary to several other research and innovation activities.|10.3030/101134977|Cluster 4

It is limited to producing 2D images on flat surfaces. Extension to 3D imaging is restricted by trade-off between focus depth and resolution. Advanced, cost-efficient solutions to fabricate wafer-scale 3D components are required.HoLiSTEP unleashes the potential of sub-wavelength Holographic Lithography (HL) as a powerful and enabling disruptive lithography. HL will overcome limitations of PL and facilitate production of novel 3D topographies with high resolution while making the production of high-resolution IC much more affordable.An industrial prototype operating at 345nm with 200nm resolution will be produced and validated in an operational environment. Several advancements in holographic stepper subcomponents must be realised: A UV fibre-based laser with 20W output power at 345nm and 1.5m coherence length, an alignment system with 25nm overlay precision, an adaptive optical system with correction precision of 1/20λ and software modules for vector diffraction models.Energy consumption of HL technology is drastically reduced compared to PL due to low power-consumption of the laser and production of complex structures in one exposure. HL images are not sensitive to mask defects, eliminating frequent mask replacements and use of toxic materials. Moreover, holographic masks act as projection optics, eliminating the need for complex optical systems.The HL prototype will be verified for 3D patterning for MEMS, MOEMS and micro-optical components to show better resolution, flexibility of 3D printing and reduced cost. HoLiSTEP will empower a positive transformative effect on environment, economy and society by enabling a wider range of companies to produce novel high-resolution 2D and 3D images at lower costs.|10.3030/101137624|Cluster 4

Starting from already existing pilot plants, BIOSAFIRE upscales and broadens the available feedstocks to provide flame retardant in powder formats for five applications in four different sectors: naval, railway, home appliances and wood coatings.Featuring the same fire retardancy performance as chosen toxic benchmarks and enhancing safety and sustainability with an 80% of biobased content, BIOSAFIRE aspires to not only demonstrate its targets on 5 use cases, but also to create a material portfolio and a set of processing guidelines to enhance flame retardants substitution by the industry. This will open the possibility for biobased resins to exhibit good fire retardant properties. It will unlock a market opportunity worth USD 9.5 billion in 2028where Europe involves a 25% share and the sectors involved in the project 65% of the market share. BIOSAFIRE will design an industrial pilot plant to understand and overcome value chain barriers and create a robust techno economic assessment to promote the market uptake of the project results.BIOSAFIRE is an opportunity to test the EU JRC SSbD framework. The project will use a tiered approach to run the framework iteratively and provide a decision support toolset, link SSbD principles to early conceptual design and ultimately provide a software tool based on HEU SUNRISE methodology.

The feedstock (biogenic waste residues) will be transported in short distances to decentralised vertical intermediate pyrolysis-based reactor (VINTER) units. The SEAFAIRER project will collect, characterise and process 3 different residual biomass feedstocks: (i) rice husk from the Valencia region, Spain; (ii) biowaste sieving material from Bavaria in Germany; and (iii) agave bagasse from southern Mexico. These feedstocks have been strategically selected from exclusively fair and residual sources without indirect land use change (iLUC) issues. The VINTER unit will convert the biomass through a single-stage intermediate pyrolysis and post-reforming process into three main products: biochar, raw oil (intermediate biofuel) and syngas. The high-quality biochar is suitable for European Biochar Certification (EBC) as carbon sink with vast agricultural and industrial applications. The carbon sink will play a crucial role to achieve the climate targets of the maritime transport sector. At commercial scale, the intermediate biofuel, which has a high energy density (approx. 32 to 36 MJ/kg), branches out into two market entry pathways that leverage existing refinery infrastructure: Pathway A is designed to cover the immediate biofuel needs of the industrial maritime shipping sector, which is under considerable regulatory pressure and has strict GHG reduction/decarbonisation targets, such as the ones set out in FuelEU Maritime. This pathway will target direct blends (B10 to B30) of intermediate biofuel (VINTER raw oil) on par with Very Low Sulfur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) according to the ISO 8217:2017 quality thresholds for marine fuels (cf. Table 4). Pathway B targets the medium- to long-term demands of the maritime industrial shipping sector. In this case, the intermediate biofuel will be upgraded via hydrodeoxygenation (HDO), targeting higher blending capacity up to pure drop-in fuel quality (B50 to B100), on par with Marine Diesel Oil (MDO) according to the ISO 8217:2017 quality thresholds for marine fuels.|10.3030/101173002|Cluster 5

MAGNO seeks to improve packaging effectiveness, sustainability, efficient usage, end-of-life (reuse and recycling), and innovative business practices in EU food systems through revolutionary strategies shaped for the ecological transition required by the European Green Deal and EU 2030 climate target plan. These strategies will strengthen the EU food and packaging policy frameworks at a local and regional level. They will also increase social innovation, consumer participation and acceptance of new packaging designs and production models in cross-border food value chains through a web platform and a series of citizen science tools. At the beginning of the project, an overview of Europe’s ecosystems and value chains for different kinds of plastic packaging will be studied. A detailed quantification of impacts and solutions in terms of health, environment, raw materials, and sustainability will then be developed to set the basis of an Ecosystem Digital Twin software. The Digital Twin will be programmed to support the analysis of different scenarios which contributes by not only providing ground-breaking strategies for improving the packaging sector but also identifying the best options in terms of innovative business. The whole project will be supported by the active participation of food multi-actors (researchers, food business operators, food packaging producers, developers of sustainable packaging, packaging converters and recyclers, consumers, and local and regional authorities). Their contribution to the creation of results and validation of the final strategies will prevent and reduce plastic packaging pollution for the food and packaging sectors.|10.3030/101135258|Cluster 6

However, the most efficient perovskite absorbers contain toxic lead. Tin halide perovskites have emerged as a highly promising alternative and efficiencies up to 14.6% have been already reported, but to become a highly efficient thin film technology, further increasing their efficiency and stability, as well as fast and homogeneous large area perovskite crystallization compatible with roll-to-roll processes are still major hurdles. These challenges are tackled within SMARTLINE-PV by the development of a fast, robust and scalable plasma assisted crystallization technology leading to high quality tin perovskite films. The benefits lie in the high speed of the process, the low temperatures involved and in the precise control of perovskite nucleation and growth by a combination of the precursor chemistry and the plasma conditions. Moreover, (i) tailored interlayers will be applied to further improve the solar cell efficiency and stability and (ii) novel device concepts to fabricate flexible tin perovskite solar cell modules with selectable colour will be implemented.The lead-free thin film PV technology developed in SMARTLINE-PV will achieve efficiencies of 25%, with significant reduction of energy consumption and manufacturing costs compared to other thin film technologies, which typically involve high temperature steps. For the SMARTLINE-PV consortium, these advancements will lead to a plethora of new opportunities to strengthen the European photovoltaics industry in many sectors including the important building-integrated (BI) PV market. Ecodesign, circularity and social acceptance will play important roles in the whole development process in which a TRL progression of tin perovskite solar cells to TRL 5 is foreseen, which will be validated by the fabrication of BIPV-demonstrators and their operation in real-life conditions.|10.3030/101122327|Cluster 5

The project will rely on the development of specific methodology and tools, tested on different case studies from industrial project’s partners, as to : 1)  reduce heat and power peak demands with an optimization of the current energy efficiency for the industrial process, (best use of waste heat and analyse of demand’s elasticity)2) define the best share between ST and PV based on technical-eco-environmental criteria3) define the ST-PV hybrid system’s architecture, the presizing of components, and the global control maximizing the use of solar heat and power.  4) develop the specific components for the best integration and use of ST and PV plants in synergy, e.g. the flexible e-TES, but also PV panels integration enablers, low cost / mid temperature solar collectors and a smart hybrid controller for heat and power joined management.A prototype (ST up to 300 kWth, PV up to 20 kWp, e-TES up to 1 MWh) will be installed on an industrial process of lubricants blending, owned by Total Energies in Spain, to validate the concept at TRL7 with a one year test campaign. The replicability of the demo is hundreds of equivalent sites.  Finally, from results gained, a global upscaling and replication potential across the South Europe and MENA areas will be achieved to assess the societal and economic benefits of the concept to meet the Net Zero by 2050 ambitions.

With the emerging functional printing of circuits and sensors, the field of in-mold electronics has extremely expanded covering several applications (i.e., Human Machine Interface in automotive and industries, condition monitoring and sensors in energy generation field, healthcare, etc.).The entire manufacturing process for in-mold electronics includes several sub-processes, most of which have a high yield of ~ 99%. However, the yield for overmolding, which is crucial for the production of complex products, is 85% at best, resulting in an overall yield that is far too low and requires high tooling and process optimization costs. Since nowadays in-mold electronic products are multi-material compounds that are difficult to recycle they do not meet the requirements of European society and policy on sustainability and circularity. The currently used capacitive sensors are not usable with cold fingers or gloves and do not provide haptic feedback, thus leading to an unsatisfactory user experience. Moreover, the direct lightning by LEDs placed in the vicinity of capacitive sensors generates a substantial heat inside the injection-molded part, leading to low durability and bad user experience in the Human Machine Interface.To overcome these limitations the objective of the MULTIMOLD project is to develop the next generation manufacturing process for products with complex geometries based on in-mold electronics with a robust, weather-resistant material concept that provides inherent recyclability by design. The MULTIMOLD complex products will combine advanced electronic functionality, multimodal sensors, haptic feedback, and power supply with micro- and nanostructured functional surfaces that may be light guiding, anti-bacterial, anti-icing, easy-to-clean and have appealing textures.|10.3030/101138427|Cluster 4

Its presence in the automotive and energy storage industry is well-established and forecasts show its incoming market uptake. However, the current BMS of FLBs lack interoperability features, resulting in a time-consuming,  expensive, and non-standardized reconfiguration process for SLB adaptation. These drawbacks complicate FLB repurposing for SLB applications, like ESS.The BIG LEAP project focuses on developing solutions for the SLBs BMS and its reconfiguration process. Technology breakthroughs will be made in its BMS, as a new three-layer architecture will be designed to ensure interoperability, safety, and reliability. It will be complemented with an adaptable ESS design to ensure BMS integration and expand the SLB's potential applications. Additionally, the BIG LEAP project intends to optimize the battery reconfiguration process by making it cost-effective, faster, and standardized. The methodology for the development of these innovations includes the collection of EV, maritime E-Vessel, and ESS batteries that will be dismantled and the data collected will serve as the basis for the BMS architecture development. It will contain adaptable SoX algorithms for accurate battery measurement, a DT for real-time monitoring, and a standardization roadmap. The new BMS will be integrated into the batteries, alongside the ESS and will be tested in three demo sites. Two physical demos will be in Paris and Prague, and a virtual demo will be in Morocco. They aim to validate the novel BMS and ESS, proving their optimization and interoperability.  The BIG LEAP innovation includes a multidisciplinary consortium, a strong business case, and an Environmental Impact assessment.

Democracy in the age of the Anthropocene will necessitate radical shifts in values, power relations and modes of governance, while also being built on the present, in all its diversity, paradox and insufficiency. Innovating to meet these challenges will require re-imagining how people living in democracies become equipped and supported to co-create resilient, democratic futures in Europe and beyond. Clear visions are needed to build strategies that allow for rethinking and redesigning spaces, institutions, instruments and ways to represent and include people in democratic governance. YouthDecide 2040 aims to support European Union democracy to rise to these challenges through evidence-based historical and contemporary knowledge, strategic foresight, and robust deliberation. Specifically, YouthDecide 2040 has the main objective to: co-create with European youth – and older generations, political and institutional actors, and organised civil society – coherent pathways to desired futures of democracy in the European Union in 2040. We translate our main objective into a series of research questions that need to be answered to support the work. Each question is connected to a key objective and corresponding work packages to support co-creation. The questions and objectives, presented below, are in order of workflow, not in order of importance. All activities are planned to be inclusive and open processes – transparently documented along the way – to enable repetition and implementation beyond the life of the project. The project’s ambition is to reinvigorate democracy in and across Europe with visions and pathways -- made with active and inclusive citizen participation -- for becoming more resilient to current and future challenges.|10.3030/101177438|Cluster 2

Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) are essential for battery manufacturing. The explosive growth of electric vehicles, driven by climate neutrality policy objectives, will pressure the CRM supply chain and increase EU dependency on third countries, resulting in decreased competitiveness for EU automotive and battery manufacturers. Implementing the digital battery passport (DBP) concept in the battery value chain could resolve these issues.The main goal of the BASE project is to develop, validate, and implement a working DBP service, as mandated by the “Regulation.” This will be achieved by exploiting data collected through a number of constantly evolving tools and methods, ensuring a transparent, secure, and cost-efficient platform operation, while also catalyzing the growth of circular businesses. BASE will develop transparent methodologies to calculate battery performance and ESGE indicators, ensuring traceability down to the CRM level throughout the entire battery value chain. In the physical domain, this will be achieved through the mass balancing approach. On the data management side, by exploiting distributed ledger technology, BASE will ensure built-in data authenticity verification along the value chain, with no data duplication, avoiding data manipulation, assuring privacy by design, and promoting data interoperability.The DBP will provide up-to-date and accurate data on battery performance indicators, remaining useful life, dismantling, material composition, and safety. This will allow for an increase in the useful service life of batteries and more efficient recycling, which will enhance resource efficiency, reduce waste, and decrease EU dependency on CRMs from third countries.

Considering the advancement of IoT ecosystems for smart homes, offices, factories and retail (by 2027, an estimated 30 billion IoT devices will be in use), powering a huge number of IoT devices solely from primary batteries would not be practically sustainable from an environmental, resource, safety and cost perspective.Energy harvesting technology has the potential to overcome these issues through providing self-sufficient, autonomous, low-power for IoT electronics by harvesting available unused energy. A promising energy harvesting technology is through light energy harvesting (LEH) of ambient indoor light using photovoltaic technology which is capable of generating power even under indoor low-light conditions.Within this class of photovoltaic devices are organic photovoltaics (OPV), which, unlike inorganic silicon, have various inherent advantages such as lightweight, flexibility, solution processability and cost-effective large area manufacturing capabilities. Moreover, OPVs can convert weak indoor light into electricity more efficiently than other PV technologies due to their spectral tunability and higher optical absorptivity as well as low leakage currents which are desirable for efficient operation of PV cells as they minimise power losses and improve the fill factor, especially at low-light intensities.The main focus of the ENLIGHTENED project is to increase the potential of PV technology for low-power, low-light applications by demonstrating the viability and potential of OPV-based LEH technology, to meet the power and energy requirements of a diverse range of customers representing Retail, Property Tech and Consumer Electronics.|10.3030/101172797|Cluster 5

Heating and cooling represent today 46% of EU energy system, that is, more than 5700 TWh, out of which, only 18% are produced with renewable sources of heating. To exploit the geothermal for energy balancing at scale, it is essential to focus on the best use of low to medium temperature resources because Europe possesses mostly low-enthalpy resources at temperature ranging from 110oC to 170oC and they are predominantly found in sedimentary formations such as the Pannonian Basin or the Upper Rhein Graben. EGS based geothermal can be developed anywhere across the EU.Low to medium temperature geothermal field developed based on either hydrothermal resources or EGS can be technically exploited by binary or ORC plant for power generation. Flexible ORC operation to produce load following power is economically challenging. nGEL is aiming to transform a geothermal ORC plant to a flexible tri-generation plant capable of both efficiently as well as cost effectively responding to the dynamic demand of power, heating, and cooling, attributing geothermal energy as a dispatchable source to balance the power and thermal grid against the progressive integration of intermittent RES (i.e., solar, wind). This will be achieved through the integration of absorption chiller, thermal energy storage, cold thermal energy storage, heat exchangers, smart control and energy management system (EMS) with AI functionalities. EMS will schedule the production and distribution of power, heat and cooling by interacting day-ahead market, grid operator, and analysing predicted energy demand and prices.If the nGEL technology can be implemented in all of the existing ORC plants in the EU,  around 215 TWht heat can be delivered to the thermal grid, which is approximately 4% of the EU current annual heat demand, which corresponds to annual economic saving (on NG import) of € 9.6 billion/year.|10.3030/101148170|Cluster 5

The objective is to build a hyperspectral Short-Wave Infra Red camera working in the wavelength range of 1 - 2 µm with integrated point detection at smaller wavelengths, specifically suitable for orchard monitoring. To reach this goal we propose a novel detector type based on QD technology, based on lead- and mercury-free QDs in compliance with EU regulations and reducing the component cost by approximately 99%. The optical filter will allow for high spectral and spatial resolution, tunable to specific application requirements by design. The hyperspectral images, recorded in-vivo, will be analyzed by deep-learning algorithms in order to identify diseases in an early state and assess the plant health, starting with apples. A data management and correlation system will be set up and present the derived diagnoses and measures directly to the farmer in real-time. The system will be mounted on an already existing autonomous tractor, customized for horticulture, in order to verify the feasibility and targeted TRLs under realistic conditions in several orchard types. HortiQD will help to reduce or avoid the usage of pesticides in European orchards, paving the way towards sustainable farming and increasing food quality. It will scale up the intensity of monitoring by automation, hence, ensure the reliability of European food production. It will help analyze and address the impacts of climate change.The project aims for a fully integrated solution, consisting of several innovative sub components.

For example, producing new metal powder in state-of-the-art processes has only 30-50% yield, with excess powder sent to lower-value uses or remelted at great energy loss. The incorporation of scrap into additive processes represents challenges in manufacturing process stability and the stability of powder production processes. Difficulty in recycling some advanced alloys that are used in additive processes makes such circular thinking difficult.REPAM aims to combat these issues across the entire process chain, starting with an industrial powder producer and researchers to deploy advanced sensors in new ways to optimise powder production process monitoring and enable the creation of new process models, including artificial intelligence. Recycling processes are also targeted by exploring the transformation of material waste into wires for directed energy deposition and scrap into powders for directed energy and powder bed processes. The manufacturing processes themselves are considered with advanced monitoring tools in combination with artificial intelligence models to enable real-time process control and optimisation, which will permit the use of a wider range of scrap in such processes. Materials design principles shall be applied to make alloys more robust for recycling purposes. Finally, the reconditioning of old or degraded metal powders is investigated to develop the technology for industrial readiness and thereby offer a more sustainable way to reuse these powder instead of simply melting them in bulk processes. All of these steps offer a reduction in materials losses and an acceptance of a wider range of materials into additive processes, in line with the work programme.REPAM aims to put the additive transformation on a sustainable footing and allow Europe to lead the way in this green paradigm shift, with the associated competitive and security benefits for the entire value chain.|10.3030/101178659|Cluster 4

The project aims to contribute to 'greener' democracies in Europe and to more democratic sustainability transition processes. GreenDEMO more particularly proposes to design, prototype, test and replicate organisational innovation in city administration in order to enable, stabilise and enhance capacities of public administration to act for climate neutrality and democratic stability.City administrations need to collaborate with stakeholders to set up local green deals. This is critical given that trust in public institutions is weakening (crisis of democracies). Moreover, even in a less challenging political climate, establishing effective political interventions in support of ambitious climate and green sustainability goals is a complex issue. Thus, there is a double pressure on democracies to secure effectiveness and democratic legitimacy. Current studies suggest that this requires public administration to build up """"transformative capacities"""". One lever to build such capacities is organisational innovation, e.g. new structures or processes, or practices. Demo Cities (Mannheim, Bristol, Aalborg) commit to such organisational innovation and will work on demonstrators, while Fellow Cities (Glasgow, Aarhus, Bamberg, Schaerbeek, Poznan) will work on replication activities and roadmaps for their own organisational change process. We assume that cities, which prove to be able to innovate their approaches and work together with their stakeholders, will be in a better position to implement (effective) local green deals. This, in turn, is expected to increase trust in public bodies and hence might be an important mechanism to strengthen democracies."""|10.3030/101178743|Cluster 2

A solution based on wavelength conversion from a 1µm laser will be matured, ensuring EU supply chain independence for power laser emission in the 1.5-3µm range. Such breakthrough laser will build the foundation of next greenhouse gases (GHG) spaceborne sensors by Integrated Path Differential Absorption Lidar (IPDA), by which GHG of interest can be probed in the 1.6μm or 2μm eye-safe regions. To meet the stringent spectral, spatial beam, and power properties required, efficient and versatile wavelength converters such as Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs) pumped by mature 1μm power lasers are key enabling technologies. This is also the approach in the European Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission (MERLIN).SIROCO will mature innovative critical optical space technologies to TRL6, including a hybrid fiber/bulk 1μm laser combined with a new Backward Wave OPO (BWOPO) concept. This will lead to a simplification shock compared to the state of the art, as no optical cavity is required (higher robustness and easier integration), nor any OPO seed source (higher compactness and simplicity in wavelength control). It will increase EU competitiveness by faster integrated, less risky, more sensitive future space IPDA.SIROCO will develop nonlinear crystals to ensure an EU supply chain, which are key components for various applications (general laser physics, IPDA emitters, quantum applications).

Relatively small adjustments to existing hydropower facilities by retrofitting reversible pump turbine technology would allow the European electricity storage capacity to increase by 22TWh/y or more. The aim will be achieved by: i) Validated innovative mechanical solutions to TRL4-5 for larger-scale pumped, longer-duration storage of electricity in existing high head Reservoir-to-Reservoir (RtR) and low head Run-of-River (RoR) hydropower facilities. ii) Mapping untapped hydropower sources for long term electricity storage in Europe increasing the availability, robustness and safety of energy storage solutions. The novel technologies will enable the operators to run hydropower stations in a more efficient, cost effective and flexible manner than today also adapting to the energy system. This is without changing the regulating heights or volume of the reservoir/river reaches following the European Green Deal priorities. Also, turbine manufacturers can introduce new components for cost-effective retrofitting of pumped storage. The technology will be validated with detailed LCA and by consideration of CAPEX and OPEX of potential future plant. The 1st innovation is based on unique design solutions for a retrofittable reversible pump turbine technology enabling a cost-effective solution free of cavitation, enhanced flexibility, and reduced losses. The 2nd innovation is enabled by digital twins including hydraulic and sediment dynamics for pumped-storage. These tools give detailed information about the status of the current storage increasing the availability and robustness of the mechanical storage of electricity in existing RoR and RtR systems adapting to, for example, predictions of generation of intermittent electricity from wind and solar.

The objective is to lower decrease the porosity and to tailor the microstructure of the deposited material by shaping the laser beam, both temporally and spatially, during the AM process. The key innovations in the project are to develop multiscale physics-based models to enable optimization of the AM process. These process parameters will be tested and matured for multi-beam control, laser beam shaping optics and high-speed scanning. To ensure the quality of the process, advanced online process monitoring and closed loop control will be performed using multi spectral imaging and thermography to control the melt pool behavior coupled with wire-current and high-speed imaging to control the process. To verify that the built material fulfills the requirements, advanced characterization will be conducted on coupons and on use-cases. The matured technology will be tested on three use-cases; aviation, maritime and automotive. These three industrial sectors span a broad part of the manufacturing volumes: from low numbers with high added value, to high numbers with relatively low cost. However, all these sectors struggle with distortions, stresses and material quality. The ALABAMA use-case demonstrators will improve the compensation for distortions during the AM process, reduce the build failures due to residual stresses, reduce porosity and improve tailoring of the microstructure. Overall, this will contribute to up to 100% increase in process productivity, 50% less defects, 33% cost reduction due to increased productivity and energy savings, a reduction of 15% in greenhouse gases and enable first time-right manufacturing thanks to simulation, process monitoring and adaptive control.

The traditional path is electronic components such as silicon chips (e.g., microcontrollers) integrated onto flexible substrates called “hybrid integration” or “flexible hybrid electronics” in integrated smart systems. We believe that this approach is not a viable long-term solution for future high-volume, low-cost and conformable integrated smart systems.  Our vision is an integrated smart system that is built with only flexible electronic components including analogue circuitry, digital logic and memories. We call such a system a “Natively Flexible Integrated Smart System” or NFISS. NFISSes will enable new products in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods and healthcare wearables that have not been possible before because conventional silicon chips are too costly, too bulky and not conformable. The project will develop a flexible microcontroller unit (FlexMCU), which is the key component missing to enable NFISSes. The FlexMCU must be a low-power chip integrating a variety of functionality to address the functional requirements of the applications in FMCG and healthcare wearables. A novel hybrid complementary low-power thin-film transistor technology (100x per-transistor power reduction) will be developed to fabricate the FlexMCU in a sustainable flexible chip fab with 100-1000x less environmental footprint. The FlexMCU design is tailored to a specific domain composed of an open-source RISC-V based processor with built-in security features, an analogue frontend, on-chip memory and other peripherals. Then, the FlexMCU will be assembled using novel assembly and bonding methods onto a flexible film, which is, in turn, integrated onto a flexible substrate along with other flexible electronic components to build the first proof-of-concept NFISS that will be validated on two healthcare wearable applications.|10.3030/101134936|Cluster 4

It develops a cross-chemistry data space for two technologies, (1) Li-ion and Na-ion coin cells and (2) redox flow batteries, addressing a triple challenge in digital manufacturing: (i) Design, (ii) operation, and (iii) trust.(i) By improved product and process design and optimization, product quality and process efficiency increase. This requires decision support that makes complex decision problems accessible to human decision makers. The digital twin technology from BatCAT provides an interpretable industrial decision support system (IIDSS) based on multicriteria optimization. Surrogate modelling connects the high-level analysis firmly to ground-truth data.(ii) Process operation and control is improved by acquiring and analysing sensory and operando data at real time, facilitating live interventions within an Industry 5.0 real-time environment. BatCAT follows a rigorous approach to actionable modelling, combining data-driven methods with deductive reasoning based on ontologies and formal methods (answer set programming and BPMN-based model checking) to guarantee a reliable behaviour.(iii) The approach from BatCAT produces trustworthy models: Machine learning always retains a clearly characterized connection to the ground truth, and any decision support or decision making from inductive reasoning is safeguarded by constraints through formal deductive reasoning. All our models and methods are explainable, and all our data are FAIR and explainable-AI-ready (XAIR).The digital twin is validated in pilot production lines for (1) coin cells and (2) redox flow batteries, proving its transferability across chemistries. The project is closely connected to the Advanced Materials 2030 Initiative, BIG-MAP and BATTERY 2030+, BEPA, DigiPass CSA, EOSC, EMMC, and the Knowledge Graph Alliance, ensuring a community and industry uptake of the results.|10.3030/101137725|Cluster 5

However, these policies have had unintended and unforeseen effects, creating new inequalities and/or aggravating existing ones. Those primarily affected are social groups already at risk and EU’s most vulnerable regions. Public authorities and policy-makers at local, national and European levels therefore need evidence-based understanding of these inequalities and concrete ways to prevent and/or mitigate these. The READJUST project aims to suggest policy options for overcoming these (potential) trade-offs between efficiency and equality in twin transitions, in the key sectors of mobility and agri-food. The green and digital policies are intended to level the field for attaining SDGs; however, they may return uneven distribution of access to the transitions and their benefits. READJUST aims to suggest options for overcoming the perceived trade-off between efficiency and equality in policy and to make inclusive growth a reality. Policymakers portray a future that is green and digital for the EU, and they aim to continuously contain the unintended consequences of the green and digital transitions in terms of inequalities. Generating zero negative effects on the climate can be efficiently achievable by twining green and digital transitions. Nonetheless, individually and jointly, the transitions might widen the existing inequality gaps.

These manufactured parts are investigated for their manufacturing tolerances upon production via quality control systems, such as a coordinate measurement machine. However, at the current state of the art, one production machine can only perform its one designated process. Additionally, these machines are generally large and bulky computer numerical control systems. As a result, these manufacturing machines are heavy and non-portable products with high investment costs. For these reasons, small investors or start-ups cannot invest in these machines, or very few of them can invest in only one type of manufacturing machine.  The aim of this project is to develop a lightweight, portable and low-cost manufacturing cell that can perform precise manufacturing and quality control. This challenge can only be solved by the collaborative work of interdisciplinary partners. Inspired by this action, Izmir Institute of Technology (IZTECH) has been firmly committed to developing and promoting enabling technologies for robotic and manufacturing systems. However, IZTECH could not fully exploit its technological and innovation potential in this field due to limited resources in research and project management. There is a clear need for concrete partnership between IZTECH and internationally leading counterparts to bring this potential into play, and thus to spread scientific excellence in robotics and manufacturing systems over the European Research Area and industry. In this way, Türkiye's excellence capacity and resources can be improved, and the research and innovation gap between Türkiye and the European Union can be closed in this specific area.

Road transport is responsible for around three quarters of transport-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, thus decarbonization of this sector is necessary to achieve a climate neutrality. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are a crucial enabler for accomplishing this target. In this frame, SOLIDBAT proposes a disruptive solid-state battery (SSB) technology to meet the challenging demands of the automotive sector. The focus is on high energy density SSB (400 Wh/kg, 1000 Wh/L) enabling fast charging, long life, and safety. To achieve these goals, SOLIDBAT entails innovation in five main areas: i) Digital tools and models for materials development and cell parameters design; ii) High capacity and water processable surface protected nickel-rich NMC cathode active material; iii) 3D-texturized high energy lithium metal anode coated with a protective artificial solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI); iv) Highly conductive and electrochemically stable hybrid gel polymer electrolyte (HGPE), crosslinked in-situ; and v) Scalable solutions for SSB technology manufacturing that are easily adaptable to current lithium-ion technology, thus hastening the introduction into the EV market. Moreover, cost, sustainability and recycling are prioritized along the whole project development, in e.g., reducing raw material use and avoiding organic solvents for greener processing. SOLIDBAT's collaborative consortium spans the whole battery value chain, fostering European innovation and industry growth.

DeCrises focuses on five objectives: To conceptualise a bottom-up MLG framework to foster citizen participation and stimulate social innovation and collaboration for an inclusive twin transition; To develop a robust MLG implementation strategy to translate the vision of a just twin transition across all levels of governance within the EU; To develop an understanding of community-led social innovations as drivers of twin transition and their role in MLG processes; To identify strategies to enhance regional and intra-regional collaboration and resilience; To facilitate and establish channels of collaboration and knowledge exchange between a diverse set of actors and explore ways to enhance policy instruments at various levels of governance.Transitioning to a green future requires significant changes to institutions historically tied to fossil fuels and limited levels of digitalisation. We focus on a shift from top-down decision-making to a more inclusive, democratic approach involving various levels of governance, including governments, businesses, and civil society. Our project provides comprehensive policy recommendations for improvement of MLG to strengthen democratic governance in the EU and ensure a just twin transition.|10.3030/101177807|Cluster 2

The originality of the project is to consider resilience in health care in a holistic approach to build individual, team and organizational capabilities to face the next extreme events and daily pressures. Therefore, we will study individual factors affecting resilience, group factors, organizational factors, and develop a model involving all types of factors. This model will serve as a basis for the production of guidelines to be disseminated to health and care workers, their managers, as well as policy makers and health systems funders. We will also develop an AI-based system to support in the identification of stress factors and recommend actions. We will involve all the stakeholders in a co-design work to finalise our solutions. We will also review the cost effectiveness of our solutions.   The main impact of our project will be a reduction of stress factors at the workplace, and an improvement of resilience of all the health and care workers. We will ensure our solutions are disseminated to all EU member states and adapted to the specifics of each of their health care systems.|10.3030/101137144|Cluster Health

New instrumentation will also lead to improve decision-making in accidental conditions thanks to additional information, complementing the material and organisational modifications decided after the Fukushima accident.The project FIND aims first to adapt innovative technologies deployed in other industries to prevent the failure of metallic pipes. FIND will work on Structural Health Monitoring technologies (ultrasonic guided waves and acoustic emission) to detect defects in real time during plant operation, even in inaccessible locations. In addition, Digital Twins will be developed to better predict degradation phenomena, with combination of detailed mechanical models and real plant data (strain, temperature and vibration measurements). Tests in experimental and industrial conditions (including NPPs) will be performed, representative of the following phenomena: - Local corrosion and large deformations of raw service water pipes, - Stress corrosion cracking and fatigue on the primary circuit, - Flow accelerated corrosion on the turbine extraction line.Concerning accidental instrumentation, FIND will first develop systems to track water movements during a loss-of-coolant accident. This will include localisation of breach thanks to heated thermocouples and data science approaches. FIND will evaluate feasibility to monitor progression of severe accidents, thanks to analysis of fission products in containment, either by gamma ray spectroscopy or physicochemical analysis.Technologies developed in FIND are low intrusive and cost effective. They will help to anticipate maintenance, and will complete or replace some Non-Destructive Testing. This will result in higher availability of NPPs, lower operator dosimetry, and reduced costs, which will foster their adoption.

Recent years have witnessed a step-change in the scale, complexity, and scope of QC with photons which recently led to 3 out of the 4 demonstrations of quantum advantage from Canadian and Chinese groups. These impressive achievements were obtained with squeezed light in bulky apparatus that are not fit for scalability. Europe shows strong leadership in development of integrated optical QC platforms, with breakthroughs in the development of high transmission dense photonic chips, record efficiency detectors and deterministic single photon sources. Photonic QC also benefits from a clear roadmap toward fault tolerant architectures proposed by leading EU quantum algorithm teams. EPIQUE gathers world leaders in photonics QC with expertise in both technology and algorithms from academia and SMEs who work together to deliver the technological breakthroughs required to push the platform toward general purpose QC. This will be achieved via new nanofabrication that combines novel switching with mature silicon compatible circuitry, via optimising both single photon sources and detectors, via new interfacing possibilities in silicon nitride and direct write modular chips, via fast low loss switching in lithium niobate, and via quantum architectures that leverage all of these advances. EPIQUE will develop three QC prototypes that will demonstrate essential building blocks of generating and fusing quantum states to entangle >10 qubits, and critical measurement and feedforward capabilities required to scale the platform to >1000 qubits. At the end of this project, we will have proven a route to general purpose quantum computing that will strengthen private investment in EU based optical QC companies.|10.3030/101135288|Cluster 4

Permafrost thaw releases large quantities of organic matter and contaminants into the environment. Contaminants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and microbiological agents locked in permafrost, are a risk for both human and animal health. In addition, permafrost thaw dramatically impacts infrastructure in local communities with wide-ranging consequences for health, economy, and society. Yet the social, physical and health components of permafrost thaw have traditionally been studied in isolation, leading to inadequate policy options that ignore the holistic nature of the threat. There is a need for an integrated and participatory approach to the complex issues at the overlap between climate change, permafrost thaw, infrastructure damage, contaminants, health and well-being and for solutions founded on the cultural, natural and social frameworks of local communities.ILLUQ is an interdisciplinary project rooted in participatory research with local stake- and rightsholders. Its mission is to tackle this need by providing the first holistic approach to permafrost thaw, pollution, One Health and well-being in the Arctic and delivering timely products on the risks from contaminant release, infrastructure failure and ecosystem changes to stakeholders.ILLUQ’s endeavor is a direct answer to the pressing needs of communities on potentially disappearing permafrost. It targets the missing link between studies performed by scientists, engineers and consultants in local communities and solutions with local stake- and rightsholders focusing on the long-term implications of decision-making in the context of permafrost thaw, a time frame generally overlooked in existing governance frameworks.|10.3030/101133587|Cluster 6

The 4-year ZOE project will analyze the links between landcover and land use changes in tropical biodiversity hot-spots facing loss of primary forest and biodiversity and in temperate regions that have undergone ecosystem degradation and deforestation over historical timescales. In areas experiencing different levels of ecosystem degradation, biodiversity assessments will be based on remote sensing-based GIS analysis of landscape structures, geobotanic plant mapping, and targeted trapping of rodents, ticks, and mosquitoes, as prototypic reservoirs and vectors of zoonotic diseases (macro-organism scale). Host- and soil-associated microbiome and virome high-throughput sequencing will be combined with assessment of human exposure to prototypic zoonotic pathogens, using high-throughput serological analyses (microbiological scale). ZOE will link with local communities and stakeholders to address perceived land use and land cover changes, disease occurrence, coping strategies, and risk behaviour. Results will be synthesized in modelling and risk mapping frameworks linking biodiversity loss and zoonotic disease risks and tested in forecasting scenarios to feed into cost-efficient monitoring schemes and early warning systems. An online knowledge platform will be created to link all relevant stakeholders of the biodiversity-health nexus, including other EU-funded consortia, national and supranational organizations stakeholders, local communities, and the public.

In scientific capability these specifications place WST far ahead of existing and planned facilities. In only 5 years of operation, the MOS would target 250 million galaxies and 25 million stars at low spectral resolution plus 2 million stars at high resolution. Without need for pre-imaged targets, the IFS would deliver 4 billion spectra offering many serendipitous discoveries. Given the current investment in deep imaging surveys and noting the diagnostic power of spectroscopy, WST will fill a crucial gap in astronomical capability and work in synergy with future ground and space-based facilities. We show how it can address outstanding scientific questions in the areas of cosmology; galaxy assembly, evolution, and enrichment, including our own Milky Way; the origin of stars and planets; and time domain and multi-messenger astrophysics. WST’s uniquely rich dataset may yield unforeseen discoveries in many of these areas. The study will deliver telescope and instrument designs, cost estimates, an updated science white paper and survey plan, concept studies for data management, and a facility operation concept.

Methodological challenges, including proprietary data, limited external validity of experiments, and the inability to use societies as experimental playgrounds, hinder our ability to comprehensively understand the impact of interventions and regulations in improving the quality of democratic discourse. AIM: WHAT-IF aims to develop and critically assess an empirically grounded simulation functioning as a digital twin of the digital political information environment. This ‘WHAT-IF machine’ can be used to test the effects of potential policy and regulatory interventions on democratic citizenship, offering a tool for evidence-based policy making in the realm of (social) media quality and regulation.APPROACH: Our innovative approach combines data donation, Agent-Based Modeling and Large Language Models to create the simulation. It is validated using immersive virtual field experiments and by modeling 'what-if' scenarios based on proposed policy interventions and regulation. Co-creation with stakeholders including policy makers and citizens ensures close alignment with their needs. Finally, a critical analysis of the whole empirical chain will give insight into the desirability and legal feasibility of datafication and simulation of the political information environment.IMPACT: Our insights into the role of the political information environment in shaping democratic citizenship will contribute to effective (social) media regulation and interventions. We will significantly contribute to novel Computational Social Science methods: we will integrate advanced AI tools with existing modeling approaches, and use respondent-centered data collection and synthetic data methods to harmonize CCS research with GDPR and other regulations.|10.3030/101177574|Cluster 2

Hence the main venture of ENCODE is to decode the meanings of emotions and encode them to policy-making strategies aiming for a positive emotional turn, breaking the cycle of depolarisation. To meet this ambitious goal, ENCODE builds its conceptual frameworks arising from a novel concept of affective pluralisation, as opposed to affective polarisation. This term serves to frame empirical research carried out in 6 geographically diverse European countries, representing both EU member states and candidates. This study will span desk research, sentiment analysis, biometric research, in-depth interviews, experiments and panel survey. Such triangulation of research techniques ensures the accuracy and validity of the findings. These are further encoded into main outputs: catalogue of best practice to tackle disinformation in social media, emotional gap maps, validated survey questions and democratic resilience heatmaps. These outputs are not expected only to enhance current scientific framework, but also are planned to underpin the future emotional narratives co-designed by diverse groups of citizens in innovations labs and further validated by Delphi expert panels and vignette experiments. This bottom-up approach anchored in citizen science ensures that policy-making strategy are in first place created by citizens and only in the next step discussed by expert teams who will elaborate policy-making strategies, the roadmap for their implementation, alongside future foresight scenarios which will be disseminated widely across EU and EU wide community of 1000+ members. This strategy creates emotional bonds between ordinary citizens, increases trust in governance and supports better informed political decision-making and communication.|10.3030/101132698|Cluster 2

According to the UN Sustainable Development goals, the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity strategy and other European and national level Directives and strategic regulations, pollution is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. The risks resulting from the use, release and effects of chemical on the environment is addressed in a plethora of EU-level Directives and regulatory strategies, each with specific (chemical) targets and protection aims. There is, however, concern that such a fragmented approach does alleviate the threats of chemicals to biodiversity and ecosystem services. To protect genetic and functional biodiversity from pollution impacts, a paradigm shift is needed. This transformation should move beyond the current fragmented Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) performed in specific regulatory silos, e.g., Plant Protection Products (PPPs)regulation for pesticides, REACH for industrial chemicals and Biocides framework for Biocidal chemicals, towards a harmonised and systems-based ERA applicable to all chemicals, species and land use functions. To make this advance, SYBERAC will provide ways forward to rationalise the current silo-based Protection Goals into high-level system-based Protection Goals and to operationalise their use within systems-based ERA robust and broadly applicable ERA structures. Six case studies, overarching different silos of current ERA will provide proof-of-concepts of the developed approaches. Based on targeted stakeholder engagement, in close cooperation with other relevant projects on the topic, results and outcomes will be disseminated towards a wide audience, including national and EU level regulatory institutions, industrial partners but also land managers, farmers and conservation bodies.|10.3030/101135213|Cluster 6

While these effects already burden low- and middle-income countries, where diarrheal diseases are the second leading cause of childhood deaths, Europe has shared and underappreciated vulnerabilities. There is an urgent need to prepare and protect our water and communities from these threats.AIM: To inform key climate, environmental, and health adaptation policies, in order to support and prepare citizens, communities and governments by better measuring the impact of future climate shocks on the burden of water-borne diarrheal diseases.APPROACH: We bring together scientists from climate, environment, health, and social sciences to collaborate with communities, industry, public authorities and policy makers across socioeconomic settings. We will model the future impact of global climate change, on local water quality and quantity, and diarrheal disease outcomes. In case studies in Ghana, Tanzania, Italy, and Romania, we will measure current interactions of climate, behaviour, and water quality on pathogen-specific diarrheal disease risks and the safety of water supply systems. We will engage individuals and communities to understand situated understandings and practices to improve risk communication and ownership. With policy makers, we will design appraisal structures to assess the economic impact and value of planetary health interventions to prevent climate-related diarrheal disease.IMPACT: SPRINGS will improve integrated climate and health surveillance, create climate-resilient water supply systems, engage citizens and stakeholders, and use evidence-based value assessments to prioritise interventions to prevent climate-induced diarrheal disease.  Long term adaptive capacity and climate-resilience will increase in Europe and beyond, preventing unnecessary illness and deaths from waterborne diarrheal disease.|10.3030/101137255|Cluster Health

In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in, for example, reproductive disorders and gender incongruence, along with a decline in fertility rates, all of which may be linked to EDC exposure. The EU has highlighted EDCs as substances of high concern and aims to minimise exposure of humans and the environment by improving regulation and policy. Yet there remain important gaps in our understanding of the impact of exposures at critical life stages and the tools for identification and ultimately regulation of EDCs. The MERLON project addresses these gaps, bringing together world-leading experts in endocrinology, chemical safety assessment, developmental and molecular biology, epidemiology, toxicogenomics, toxicokinetics modelling, regulatory toxicology, psychology, psychiatry and research ethics. We will investigate EDC-mediated effects on sexual development, providing human data on the role of EDC exposure during fetal development and changes in mini-puberty, connecting to puberty, reproductive function, and gender incongruence using existing biobanks and cohorts. MERLON will apply and develop 3R-compliant New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) focusing on sexual development and function and the effects of EDCs thereon. Our cutting-edge approaches incorporate transcriptomics, pharmacokinetic models, biomarker identification and the use of Adverse Outcome Pathways, which we will utilize to develop a roadmap for EDC identification, making the best use of NAMs into the future. With MERLON, we will engage EU risk assessment bodies, public health authorities, regulators, scientists and researchers, healthcare providers and citizens. This will ensure all relevant stakeholders have the evidence they need to minimize EDC exposure and support effective and evidence-based regulations and policies.|10.3030/101137411|Cluster Health

However, this research did not address to a satisfactory extent the societal aspects of climate change in the EMMENA region that fall under the Sustainable Development (SD) field. Although being very active in relevant research areas of Sustainable Development and in particular, water, renewable energy and oceanography, UCY has not achieved to address the socioeconomic aspects of Sustainable Development research. It is rather positioned in a fragmented fashion in the SD research field by having research teams involved in relevant projects and undertakings but not in a concerted way, thus currently tackling important research topics sporadically and without coherence. This gap is not limited to climate change-related fields but on other aspects of SD such as gender equality, innovation law, science diplomacy and economic development, poverty reduction and income inequalities. The TWIN2SUSTAIN project aims to address this gap in this crucial research area by facilitating a partnership with two advanced partners in the SD field, UNU-MERIT and UANTWERP, in order to advance and consolidate in a multidisciplinary context all related research activities at the University of Cyprus (UCY), with main focus on the socioeconomic aspects of SD. This vision will be realised by applying for a Horizon Europe/Twinning grant, in conjunction and under the aegis of the Research and Innovation Service of UCY and with many different UCY academic departments and research units engaged. By linking UCY with these internationally leading partners in SD, TWIN2SUSTAIN will stimulate research excellence and international visibility of UCY, while improving the networking efficiency and innovation in this growing and very important field.|10.3030/101159116|Other

Nevertheless, the adoption rate of key digital technologies, such as AI, by MSMEs remains significantly low in the EU (DESI 2022), positioning the Union far from the Digital Decade target of 75%+ European companies adopting AI technologies by 2030. In most of the countries represented in the consortium, the AI adoption rate does not even reach the EU average. The European wholesale and retail trade sector is the 3rd to last in the EU regarding the adoption rate of AI technologies. A lack of a skilled workforce to adopt the integration of AI in retail hinders not only market growth in the EU and represents a significant risk for European SMEs of falling behind their global competitors and missing out on significant opportunities for growth and efficiency, and for making companies greener. In this context, the INAIR project proposal aims to reduce the AI skills gap of European MSMEs in Retail, to let them exploit the potential of AI for greening their businesses, support their competitiveness in the global market and ultimately contribute to reaching the digital decade target of 75%+ European companies adopting AI technologies by 2030. To achieve its aim, over 30 months, the consortium will:-Identify AI skills needs and gaps for MSMEs in retail in CY, DE, IT, PL and RO;-Devise, test and implement a scalable hybrid AI skills development program to re-/up-skill at least 150 owners and employees of MSMEs working in retail;-Develop teaching and training resources to support VET providers in integrating the project resources and tools into their work.Key results: AI Skill Needs & Gaps Analysis in retail; AI Core Curriculum, Skills Assessment Tool and Open Educational Resources for workers and owners of micro, small and medium-sized retailers; eLearning Environment.|10.3030/101133847|Cluster 4

The market of Energy Storage Systems is now undertaking continuous growth, boosted by the relentless penetration of renewables. In this context, state of the art ESSs still have several limitations mainly due to technological constraints. Technology-dependent reaction times and rigid coupling between energy and power capacity, makes the choice of a specific ESS for different use cases very cumbersome and seldom optimal from both the technical and economic point of view. SMHYLES project proposes novel sustainable Hybrid Energy Storage Systems (HESSs) based on the combination of two low-CRM storage technologies, one with long duration capacity and one with very high-power density, providing ultra-fast ancillary services, managed in a combined control by smart EMSs. The projects comprehend the design, construction, deployment and demonstration of an Aqueous-based HESS (AHESS) and a Salt-based HESS (SHESS) as well as a storage duration expansion. Three demo sites in Portugal and Germany cover islanded grid, industrial microgrid, provision of grid services and EV charging use cases. Novel solutions for electrolyte recycling are also scaled up to industrially relevant size. The project will finalize techno-economic analyses to evaluate market segments for HESSs commercialization and deal with life cycle assessment along the whole design process. Digital twins are developed to support the optimal design of HESSs components and systems, define the strategies for HESSs real time management, investigate the business potential of SMHYLES solutions for specific use cases and countries, and support and test the energy management systems of the developed hybrid storage technologies. With high technological and economical advancements, SMHYLES will unlock novel flexible and multi-purpose energy storage solutions and ensure a remarkable impact on the European energy market.|10.3030/101138029|Cluster 5

Upcoming RIAs should integrate and capitalise on ongoing efforts, with a vital aspect for Europe in this whole process being to successfully combine and consolidate the technology priorities defined by EU industry through the “European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud” and the advancements that the IPCEI-CIS will provide in the coming years. This transition and the move of the whole community of EC-funded projects and related initiatives towards a closer cooperation with industry is what the NexusForum.EU project aims to support and facilitate by focusing on consolidating research and policy along the Cognitive Computing Continuum, something crucial to effectively expand what the ongoing CSAs (particularly EUCloudEdgeIoT) are working on, thus providing a clear, consistent vision for future research and innovation topics in this EU strategic area. NexusForum.EU, through its unique consortium, will be able to effectively undertake a number of crucial activities, such as producing annual research roadmaps and policy recommendations; fostering collaboration between industry and academia; creating solid links with the IPCEI-CIS and the “European Alliance for Industrial Data, Edge and Cloud”; collaborating with past and present RIAs in order to promote a diverse EU research and innovation community; identifying relevant issues such skills development gaps; analysing the relationship with crucial topics such as Open Source and Open Standards; and engaging with forward-looking research and innovation communities and strategic initiatives outside Europe (starting with Japan & South Korea).|10.3030/101135632|Cluster 4

Steel can be recycled over and over again while retaining its technical properties. However, contaminations of tramp elements and losses of alloying elements do occur in the solid state and liquid state recovery processes currently employed in the industrial value chain. The project aims to enhance the integrated value chain of scrap based steel production through; investigate and develop scrap preparation methods, research new ways of sorting and separation of material, investigate and develop specific methods to remove copper and tin in the liquid phase and to recover copper form steelmaking residues through pyrometallurgical processes, create new steel products that can handle a higher copper content while maintaining required application properties, and finally lab-scale experiments to develop thermodynamic and kinetic modelling focusing on tramp elements. The target is to achieve 90% EOL recovery rates and a reduction of tramp elements by 60-70%, improved separation and sorting of scrap with a targeted increase in separation specificity of 50% and a target of copper element recovery from steelmaking residues about 60%.  Ultimately the developed models will, when relevant, be verified with data from full-scale tests in industrially relevant environments.The consortium includes 8 partners from 5 different EU-countries a scrap recycler (STEIL) / a steelmaker (SIDENOR) – and different R&D entities (KTH, KOBOLDE, TECNALIA, University of Limerick and Politecnico de Bari)  as well as a supplier (LSA) of sensors for scrap identification covering all the competences needed for the development of the MEDALS project|10.3030/101138516|Cluster 4

PV panels for clean energy generation, and batteries for energy storage are key components for the green energy transition but heavily depending on CRMs. However, as the PV and EV markets were developing fast in the last decade in Europe, significant amount of secondary EV batteries, and PV panels will be available for recycling. Traditional approaches that have been used so far for their recycling are focused on materials recovery, and less on the enormous potential for reuse in second life before recycling. Additionally, proposed recycling processes so far are still suffering from several issues related to purity and efficiency of the processes as well as high cost and environmental aspects.  The overarching aim of the SOLMATE project is to set up solid foundations of a new industrial value chain for the sustainable reuse and recycling of PV solar panels and EV batteries in interesting emerging markets and high added value applications. The main objectives of SOLMATE are on one hand i) to develop and demonstrate viable and guaranteed low-cost decentralised energy systems for different emerging markets and business cases based on the reuse of batteries from EoL EV and used PV solar panels (i.e., repowering from PV farms), and on the other hand, ii) to demonstrate low cost and environmentally friendly technologies for improving the purity and increasing the recovery of raw materials (especially critical raw materials) from EoL EV batteries and PV that cannot be reused.SOLMATE is designed to be fully aligned with the “waste hierarchy” principles as indicated in the Waste Framework Directive (Prevention, Reuse, Recycling, Recovery, Disposal).|10.3030/101138374|Cluster 4

The key potential of the concept of Product Service System (PSS), besides radical improvements in the use of products, is a reduction of environmental footprint of products and services. The overall footprint of PSS is still insufficiently investigated. The services within PSS are an important, insufficiently used source of (digitalized) data on the product and its use. It is likely that digital means facilitating provision of consistent “track and trace” information on the origin, composition and entire life cycle not only of a product but of all services offered and used around the product, will offer important contribution towards achievement of full circularity for manufacturing. The key idea of PSS-Pass is to investigate how extension of DPP to Digital Product Service System Passport (DPSSP) can be effectively achieved and how it will allow for improved circularity of the manufacturing industry. The overarching hypothesis is that LCA underpinned by Machine Learning (ML) methods and informed by dynamic data paves the way to more accurate LCA while supporting PSS life cycle decision making. The collected and sharable data from DPSSP will allow to effectively apply ML as well as Digital Twin (DT) for more reliable decision-making processes concerning circularity of PSS. The project will provide Methodological Framework for definition, development and update of DPSSP, Digital Environment for DPSSP built on existing interoperability architectures, set of ontologies for improved interoperability at DPSSP Environment, novel DT-based Simulation Framework, for modelling standardized and interoperable DTs for PSS lifecycle analysis, and AI based method/tool to forecasts the environmental impact of PSS.

This is unacceptable, particularly with climate impacts sure to get even worse. Early warnings and action save lives. To that end, today I announce the United Nations will spearhead new action to ensure every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems within five years.”- UN Secretary-General António Guterres on World Meteorological Day 2022/03/23The ambition of the Strengthening Extreme Events Detection for Floods and Droughts (SEED-FD) project proposal is to give Europe, with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service, a leading position with this regard by breaking the current limitations of hydrological simulation accuracy and reliability and providing skillful floods and droughts forecasts available anywhere in the world, including in the global south for lower and middle-income countries, typically the most impacted by extreme hydrological events but also where the current knowledge gap in hydrological simulation and forecasting is highest.Combining state-of-the-art science with crucial advances in EO and non-EO technologies, the project's global objective is to enhance the quality and portfolio of the CEMS EWS for floods and droughts and improve the reliability of predictions all over the world. SEED-FD will target every critical part of the CEMS Hydrological Forecasting Modelling chain by applying state-of-the-art science to transform new observational information into high-quality hydrometeo extreme event forecast products. It will invest in better representing hydrological processes and parameterisation techniques of the CEMS core hydrological engine (LISFLOOD) and combine the model enhancements with innovative techniques to integrate EO and non-EO data with the near real-time hydrological processing chain for reducing hydrological forecasting errors.|10.3030/101135110|Cluster 4

NGT products are currently regulated as genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in the EU. This means that they are subject to authorisation procedures, which include event-specific methods for detection, identification, and quantification of the corresponding food and feed products. However, the analytical methods commonly used for transgenic GMOs are often not suitable for NGT products as these often do not contain genetic elements that allow unambiguous traceability. DETECTIVE will investigate the technical forefront for detection including the latest PCR-based and sequencing approaches for NGT products with known and unknown genetic alterations, and validate these in national enforcement laboratories. We will build a cluster of databases to enable Machine Learning-based screening. While technical detection may be limited, DETECTIVE will also look into non-technical approaches to traceability and authenticity to develop comprehensive solutions, including their respective economic and legal implications, to a wide range of NGT products. By taking a systemic and holistic approach, DETECTIVE will identify the boundary conditions that traceability approaches need to meet. The results will promote NGT research and innovation (R&I) that enable a resilient primary production (agriculture and animal husbandry) of highly nutritional food products and thereby contribute to a sustainable, healthy and inclusive food system in Europe that enables choice for both producers and consumers. DETECTIVE is a multi-disciplinary and multi-sectoral consortium and its links to relevant stakeholders through a Stakeholder Advisory Board will enable an improved understanding and awareness of the challenges related to traceability, authenticity and transparency of NGT-derived products.|10.3030/101137025|Cluster 6

The ODD, by design, defines the operating environment for which a system is designed for. On the other hand, Authorities and Road Operators are responsible for operating the PDI with a variety of vehicles and systems with limited knowledge on the diverse ODD specifications. To answer the question of how safe is a CCAM service, one should not only address the ODD used for shaping the functional boundaries of CCAM (top down), but also the infrastructure, system related, safe and secure communications related and conditions (traffic, weather, hazards) related aspects of the road environment these systems will operate (bottom up). The grande challenge is to design broader ODDs that allow for cooperation with the PDI in a safe system design framework; the industry cannot unilaterally develop and operate sustainable and robust ODDs without the feedback from Authorities and Operators. Future ODDs should be designed with many redundancies (fail safe design) to allow for increased tolerance to vehicle- and context-specific capabilities and human errors and cooperate with physical and digital road infrastructure to boost proactive safety; Seamless, safe and secure physical and digital environments must coexist and collaborate to allow for the appropriate levels of data, information and decisions flow. FRODDO’s vision is a future of robust, safe, secure and seamless connectivity and automation that can adapt to physical, technological and social challenges and support user centric mobility and development. FRODDO’s overarching aim is to develop and test a complete suite of methods and tools based on the principles of safe systems design in a federated DT environment leveraging advanced sensing, ML, hybrid AI and simulation to account for increasing adaptability and sustainability of ODDs to complex and dynamically changing road contexts and allow for improved management of CCAM-enabled PDI.|10.3030/101147819|Cluster 5

EAC is notorious for its highly aggressive biological behavior leading to invasive disease and early metastases. The only way to reduce mortality is through treatment in early stage of the cancer. EAC has a well recognized premalignant precursor lesion identified as esophageal metaplasia, or Barrett’s Esophagus (BE), which offers important opportunities for treatment in early stages of cancer which may reach 5 years survival rates up to 80%. However, these patients need to be monitored constantly for timely intervention in case of disease recurrence or metastases. The problem is that after endoscopic treatment up to 30% of cases will develop recurring cancers or even present with metastases, which requires additional endoscopic treatments or surgery. Currently it is impossible to predict which of the treated BE patients with  will have stable disease and which will recur or progress to invasive cancer. As a consequence all treated patients need to remain in frequent endoscopic surveillance. This leads to over-treatment of a large group of BE patients and under-treatment of those with more aggressive disease. There is a low cost effectiveness of endoscopic therapies, low quality of life of patients and poor satisfaction of care providers. An accurate risk stratification method for early AEC in BE patients is therefore an unmet clinical need. The ambition of the ENDEAVOR  consortium is to implement an innovative risk stratification method, which encompasses minimally invasive cell collection supplemented by single cell genomic analysis to address this specific need. Taking into account patient characteristics, gender dimensions, an optimal model model will be tested in a randomized controlled prospective trial. Future implementation of this method will reduce health care costs, increase quality of life and satisfaction of health care providers.

Worldwide, COPD is the third leading cause of death. The symptom burden of people with COPD is as severe and burdensome as the symptom burden of people with lung COPD. While palliative care in many countries is available for people with lung COPD, palliative care and good end-of-life care for people with COPD are not well integrated into their treatment by respiratory hospital teams in Europe.The EU PAL-COPD project is a multidisciplinary, interprofessional, international and intersectoral project aiming at evaluating the clinical and cost-effectiveness of the ICLEAR-EU intervention for people with advanced COPD in different healthcare systems in Europe.ICLEAR-EU is a person-centred and family-centred non-pharmacological service intervention in which respiratory teams in the hospital collaborate with interdisciplinary palliative care teams and with primary care to promote shared decision-making and advance care planning, improve symptom treatment and comfort care, and prevent re-hospitalization after an exacerbation. ICLEAR-EU is based on an existing intervention developed and pilot tested in the UK.In EU PAL-COPD, the effectiveness of ICLEAR-EU will be assessed with a stepped wedge cluster RCT in 1,224 people with advanced COPD in 18 hospitals across six European countries. It is hence the first large-scale international trial on systematic integration of palliative care in respiratory care for people with advanced COPD. Cost-effectiveness, robust mixed methods subgroup analyses and in-depth process and implementation evaluations are also included.EU PAL-COPD will improve the well-being and empowerment of people with COPD and their families and advance the state of the art by providing an innovative service model to the complex palliative and end-of-life care needs.

Caring for the increasing numbers of people across Europe with advanced dementia and palliative care needs who live in care homes is difficult and demanding. People with advanced dementia can be immobile, non-verbal and unable to take part in day-to-day activities. They can be unsettled or agitated, with low quality-of-life and elevated levels of discomfort. Family members can find it difficult to connect meaningfully with their relative and are anxious about the future. Care staff can struggle to provide care other than for basic needs such as feeding, toileting and skin care. Solution. An ethically sound solution which advances beyond the science, providing both care ‘in-the moment’ (using Namaste Care) and planning for future care needs (using the Family Carer Decision Support ‘Comfort Care’ approach). We call this the In-Touch intervention. Plan. To deliver a cross-country cluster randomised controlled trial of the In-Touch intervention in 56 nursing care homes across 7 countries to determine its effect on comfort, social engagement and quality of life. This is supported by 9 work packages ensuring that: the intervention is robustly planned and contextualised for different country settings; there is understanding of how it is delivered, and what people experience and ethically value about the intervention; the cost-effectiveness is understood; we have effective plans to transfer knowledge about this intervention if it is successful.  Impact. This intervention could herald a major change in the way that care for people with advanced dementia, in the palliative phase of their illness, is provided across Europe. People with advanced dementia should have better quality of life as they approach death, improved engagement and reduced social isolation. Care staff will have an ethically sound and evidence-based intervention that is cost-effective to implement, with family members more involved in, and knowledgeable about, comfort care and future care plans.|10.3030/101137270|Cluster Health

CHI is a major cause of hypoglycemic brain injury with intellectual disability, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. As no registered causal therapy exists, management of CHI aims at increasing blood glucose levels causing severe side effects in all patients while life-threatening frequent hypoglycaemias remain. Removal of hyperfunctioning beta cells by pancreatectomy leads to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and maldigestion of food, changing one disease for another with severe secondary morbidity. Management of CHI is choosing between evils and symptomatic management is partially effective in only some sub-types. CHI also represents a major burden for families, because of disability but also as a result of continuous monitoring and correction of glucose levels for many years, requiring permanent alertness. Health problems and economic decline occur in most parents. A normal life is not feasible for families with babies with CHI. LightCure consortium partners have demonstrated the feasibility of selectively targeting beta cells using exendin 4 (EX) labelled with a photosensitizer (700DX) specifically binding to beta cells. This photosensitizer can be activated by light of a certain wavelength and will produce radical oxygen species leading to cell damage, a principle called targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT). In this project we will build on existing cutting-edge technology exclusively available to the consortium partners and perform human proof of concept studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of tPDT with EX700DX. We will deliver the proof-of-concept that after injection of EX700DX, minimally invasive tPDT leads to normalization of blood glucose levels avoiding morbidity, enabling a normal life for babies with CHI and their families.|10.3030/101080327|Cluster Health

Due to these difficulties, access to effective treatments and the number of treatment options are often limited in RDs. INVENTS aims to provide clinical trial trialists, researchers and regulators with a global framework encompassing methods, workflows and evidence assessment tools to be implemented in orphan and paediatric drug development. Our ambition is to significantly improve the evaluation of evidence and regulatory decision-making through the development and validation of: refined longitudinal model-based diseases trajectories and treatment effect, improved extrapolation models, in silico trials (e.g., virtual patient cohorts), optimised model-based clinical trial designs and evidence synthesis methods. These will be evaluated through simulation studies and tested on extensive data from a range of use cases provided by our industrial partners Roche and Novartis and Real World data (RWD) from RD registry. The INVENTS framework will improve consistency and efficiency of the drug evaluation process for RD by augmenting clinical evidence without compromising its scientific integrity and providing regulators assessment credibility criteria. At the end of this 5 years project, the European industry will be able to exploit novel and improved clinical trial designs, in silico trials and RWD analysis approaches supporting drug development in RD. The European Medicine Agency and European national regulators (including Health Technology Assessment bodies) will be supplied with a general framework allowing better informed decision-making.

DHTs are also able to collect real-world data and evidence relevant for decision makers. However, the implementation of DHTs implies new methodological challenges to the standardisation of assessment criteria. Existing Health Technology Assessments (HTAs) are unable to capture the real added value of DHTs. EDiHTA will be the first flexible, inclusive, validated and ready-for-use European HTA framework reaching TRL 6-7, allowing the assessment of different DHTs (e.g. telemedicine, mApps, AI) at different TRLs, territorial levels (national, regional and local) and perspectives (e.g. payer, society, hospital). All relevant stakeholders will contribute to its design, development and validation. The digital framework will be piloted in real healthcare settings in 5 major European hospitals and through an open piloting scheme with European DHT developers. The principles of EDiHTA are to 1) promote a holistic approach involving all stakeholders for consensus building at national and European levels; 2) define a common terminology, harmonise and enrich existing HTA frameworks and create an open repository with frameworks, guides, articles and HTA methodologies; 3) optimise assessment processes along the DHT life cycle; 4) follow a multi-stakeholder, multi-domain and modular approach; 5) co-create EDiHTA solutions; and 6) provide a validated and ready-for-use digital HTA framework for DHTs. Next to leading academic groups in HTA research, our multidisciplinary consortium includes HTA agencies, clinics as DHT end-users, technology providers and a patient organisation with links to the broader European healthcare landscape of regulatory bodies, policymakers and payers.

BSOs represent huge European public investments, estimated at €38.7 Bn for the coming years. BSOs are recognized as drivers for innovation with a huge impact on society in fields such as energy, health, materials, environment and IT. INPROCAP will establish co-designed innovative procurement practices in BSOs. Through INPROCAP, a fragmented network of Industrial Liaison Offices (ILOs) will  be able to provide Advisory Services, and involve their huge network of national and international SMEs and deep connections to the innovation ecosystem. More than 200 companies will be engaged in innovative procurement for BSOs through INPROCAP.  The INPROCAP consortium is uniquely positioned to potentiate innovation procurement opportunities for BSOs, by involving four ILO networks (DTI/DK, NWO/NL, CDTI/ES, NCBJ/PL) covering the entire European region – the ILOs will co-create and receive training on innovation procurement (developed with and provided by an SME with vast experience in innovation procurement – PEDAL/SK). INPROCAP partners will engage their wider network of start-ups and innovative companies, while ensuring that BSOs are capable and prepared to embark on innovation procurement processes. BSOs are directly involved in INPROCAP through EuXFEL/DE and EISCAT/SE, who will identify their innovation procurement needs that will be presented to SMEs for co-design.  Through INPROCAP, innovation procurement will become a standard tool in the BSO toolbox. The potential of SMEs to increase their supply of innovations to the public sector BSOs will be widely disseminated, and the innovation procurement cases developed in INPROCAP will serve as examples for BSOs across the world, contributing to overcome the current dispersion observed in innovation procurement.|10.3030/101157621|Other

IDOP will be interoperable with over 40 energy management systems and 60 smart appliance vendors and cover 90% of the flexibility in buildings and industrial sites.IDOP will help to reduce energy costs and CO2 emissions by providing open interfaces, innovative AI, and optimisation solutions for flexible resource modelling, optimal control, multi-market operation, and the automated integration of legacy systems. Simultaneously, IDOP will significantly reduce the development, deployment, and operational expenses, thereby establishing DSFM as a sustainable business on a large scale. IDOP commits to full compliance with the DSFM standards, including the EN 50491-12 and IEC 62746 standard families, and the SAREF ontology. Additionally, IDOP introduces Gaia-X-compatible data spaces to govern data in buildings and industrial sites.The project brings together 14 partners, including four aggregators, seven EMS service companies, and two major home appliance manufacturers that will adopt IDOP-based solutions into their offerings. The IDOP-based CEMS and AEMS will be demonstrated and qualified in large-scale pilots in four countries. A total of 1,4 MWh flexibility capacity will be harnessed from buildings and industrial sites and connected to eight operational energy wholesale, TSO, and DSO flexibility markets to demonstrate the CEMS and AEMS at TRL 8. The IDOP solutions will enable the energy transition by reducing GHG emissions by 1.9 million tons a year for all customers in 6–10 years. The solutions provide also significant monetary benefits: 15% RoI and 3,6 billion EUR cost reductions a year compared to the situation without any DSFM solution.|10.3030/101172675|Cluster 5

The viruses studied in SHIELD are from the genera of flavivirus (DENV, WNV, YFV, Zika), mammarenaviruses (LASV) and henipaviruses (Hendra, Nipah). We bring a broad spectrum of methodical expertise to understand and exploit the interrelated processes of viral glycosylation and viral dynamics. Molecular simulations will enable the identification of cryptic pockets in viral proteins that form during the entry process, and the design of inhibitory ligands that bind to such pockets. Theoretical methods will be used to identify ligands for glycosylated viral proteins. This is intertwined with cryo-EM and nano-resolution optical microscopy which enable a detailed analysis of these events, their sensitivity to biological and chemical interference, and will allow a rational optimization of specificity and affinity. Novel chemical and biological entities (NCEs, NBEs) as tool compounds and potential starting points for drug development are obtained by targeted chemical synthesis, X-ray fragment screening, and nanobody library screens. Additionally, we study biological processes and the influence of interactions in systems of increasing complexity, which range from biochemical in-vitro to cellular assays and in vivo animal models. As the ‘glycan shield’ in Lassa/Hendra/Nipah plays a major role in immune evasion, we explore the immunological effects of an interference with protein glycosylation leading to novel starting point towards the development of effective and robust vaccines. In conclusion, SHIELD delivers a deeper understanding, and molecular tools to prepare the EU for future pandemic events.|10.3030/101191794|Cluster Health

The current management of oceans, seas and coasts is fragmented across multiple institutional layers and policy areas and based on past experience. BlueGreen Governance pursues an innovative approach to the governance of the seas and coastal areas that: promotes integration between institutional layers and across policy sectors with a clear impact on the use of the land and the sea; involves and engages citizens in decision-making processes, while at the same time including scientific evidence; responds predictively to changing physical conditions as indicated by scientific evidence as well as indigenous and local knowledge and citizen science; and uses e-governance tools in support of the previous three points. With this focus and approach, the project responds to the need for better-informed decision-making processes, social engagement and digital innovation while promoting more harmonious and effective science-policy-society interfaces. The promotion of better science-policy, science-society and society-policy interactions will be embedded in the digital transformation and application of e-governance tools for co-design and service delivery. BlueGreen Governance will implement and assess these innovative governance schemes in 8 cases across several European regions and sea basins and will draw lessons on how to trigger and facilitate effective institutional change via capacity building. The cases are: Comunidad Valenciana; North Adriatic; the Solent; Western Scheldt; Oslofjord; Canary Islands and Reunion. With this geographical scope, the project will investigate five marine basins (Western Mediterranean Sea, Eastern Mediterranean Sea, North Sea, Atlantic Ocean and Indian Ocean), including one transnational marine basin (i.e. the North Adriatic case) and one transnational river basin (i.e. the Western Scheldt case).|10.3030/101086091|Cluster 6

This ambition requires fast mitigation measures within all sectors. Paludiculture is the productive land use of wet and rewetted peatlands and can reduce GHG emissions by up to 70-80%. It thus has a large potential to support the EU’s climate targets and biodiversity strategy and still provide farmers and landowners with income, but only if the practice is scaled up. Currently, there are too few large-scale sites involving local actors that demonstrate industrial scale paludiculture farming models.PaluWise's 4 large-scale paludiculture sites in Finland, the Netherlands, Poland, and the United Kingdom will showcase best practices and solutions for converting degraded organic soils to paludiculture. They develop field-scale operations and their associated five value chains (crops: Downy Birch, Reed, Sedges, Typha, Reed Canary Grass). By having two established (NL, UK) and two new sites (FI, PL), PaluWise can demonstrate different stages of paludiculture and associated value chains, emphasising replicability and scalability. Network sites (e.g., PaludiZentrale, Germany) will provide lessons learnt guidance and engage actors in innovating improvements (e.g. maintaining high water levels, adapting machinery, choosing suitable crop species). A multi-actor approach is applied to co-innovate and improve cost-effective, climate smart value chains. Activities cover the full sequence from deciding where to set up a site (WP1 decision support tool for rewettability), what works well in a site (WP2 demos), what are the benefits/impacts in emission reduction, carbon sequestration potential, biodiversity and other ecosystem services at landscape scale (WP3, WP4), and how to upscale and get support (WP5).

Delays and backlogs in regular care, as a result of the stretched health care system, leave millions of patients with regular care needs unattended, resulting in disastrous healthcare outcomes. If poor healthcare outcomes across the population are to be avoided, healthcare systems must become more resilient and flexible and allow for rapid changes in the care delivery services. RAPIDE’s aim is to develop, validate and demonstrate a portfolio of powerful tools that enable healthcare systems to build in robustness of decisions, resilience of the health care professionals and patients and flexibility in the modalities of care delivery, thereby maintaining access to regular care during health emergencies. RAPIDE emphasises opportunities for optimising in-hospital care, but also for relocating care from hospitals to community and home environments without loss of care quality. Thus, the project focuses on two closely-linked challenges – 1: Identifying and predicting how much care, and which care, needs to be moved along the care chain; 2: Identifying and verifying effective, feasible and acceptable ways to make this reconfiguration of care a reality. This will be achieved by (a) resource modelling, which builds comprehensive foresight and forecasting solutions and links them to patient flows optimization, along the whole chain of care, (b) selecting and implementing the best available tools to deliver regular care in new ways. To ensure usability, acceptability and equitable real-world value, RAPIDE will be co-designed and co-validated with stakeholders, from patients, GPs, clinicians and hospital managers to health ministries, pandemic-management and public health agencies.

Therefore, the TAICo project sets out to develop, implement, and validate a model of Teacher-AI Complementarity that applies to the broader teaching profession across primary and secondary general education, higher education, and continuing education and training. Our model will enhance the understanding of the potential impacts of AI in aligning with human skills for teaching and learning. In 12 studies, we will apply and assess AI technologies in authentic educational settings in six countries (Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Netherlands, UK). Aligned with the new European Skills Agenda, these studies will focus on activities that aim to support a variety of lifelong learning skills including collaboration, problem-solving, and self-regulation. This will allow us to derive practical and evidence-based guidelines for all stakeholders involved (incl. teachers, educational institutions, educational technology industry, and policy makers) and significantly contribute to the productive and ethical integration of AI in education. The project will actively engage stakeholders in participatory design activities and policy dialogues to shape the future agenda for how AI is developed and deployed, how teachers and EdTech developers are prepared, and how European policies respond to the future challenges of an AI-enhanced education system.

This interaction is specially concerning in developmental stages of life, such as the perinatal period and puberty. Despite the current body of knowledge on EDC actions on the endocrine system, a comprehensive, holistic understanding of the impact on the HP axis is still lacking. HYPIEND aims to understand the effects of EDC co-exposure in the function and epigenetic programming of the HP axis to delineate interventional strategies for minimizing exposure and consequences on the neuroendocrine system during the perinatal and pre-pubertal stages. To do that, a computational toxicology methodological framework will be built leveraging public data and state of the art data analysis techniques to define EDC co-exposure patterns in target population. The resulting patterns will be evaluated in a sequential tiered approach consisting in cell-based screenings, Danio rerio models of HP axes, in vitro, in silico and in vivo models of placenta and blood brain barrier diffusion and new models of organoids-based organ-on-chip recapitulating the HP axis. EDC effects on epigenetic programming will be evaluated in preclinical models of perinatal and early childhood. Whole genome DNA methylation patterns in the different models will be explored as a source of non-invasive biomarkers of HP axis disruption by EDC. The knowledge generated in preclinical models will be applied in two multi-centre-controlled intervention studies intended to minimize exposure to EDC in children in the perinatal and pre-puberty stages.

This is achieved by developing two unique solutions: 1) the Employability Growth Index (EGROW Index) - a comprehensive taxonomy of individuals employability growth, including their empowerment and transformative (digital & green) capabilities (objective 1). The EGROW Index will act as a measurement tool for classification and segmentation of user groups regarding the content and format of learning programmes. 2) the Modular and Versatile Platform for Engagement and Employability (MOVE) – a digital platform for lifelong learning with person-centered micro-credentials and learning formats (objective 2). On MOVE individuals can grow their employability based on EGROW and skill forecasts by participating in concise skill programmes recommended by an AI-supported system. To benchmark the impact breadth of the EGROW Index and MOVE, econometric cost-benefit analyses and a stochastic life-cycle model are applied (objective 3). The objectives are enabled by a vibrant research and innovation environment – the Grassroot Living Lab. State-of the art social innovation experiments, iterative research and stakeholder integrated co-creation will validate the DIAMOND solutions. DIAMOND targets directly the main impact goals associated with the call. The EGROW Index will help individuals to assess their employability growth and to empower them to self-manage their skill development on MOVE.

The molecular and physiological mechanisms of how these viral infections cause and contribute to non-communicable disease development are unknown. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a virus that infects nearly all infants before the age of 2 years and that is linked to asthma development. We propose an integrative approach to identify genetic risk factors and mechanisms underlying virus-induced asthma. Specifically, using two national cohorts (Estonian and Spanish), we will identify human genetic risk factors and RSV strains that contribute to severe bronchiolitis. We analyse how RSV perturbs intracellular networks to change cellular properties that trigger asthma development. We will use Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based techniques to integrate generated data with the current biological knowledge, to generate RSV-induced perturbation signatures and to identify drug-like compounds able to revert the effects of the RSV-induced perturbations. We will validate both mechanisms and candidate compounds in patient derived airway organoid models and, when promising, in a controlled human infection model trial. CLARITY will impact the understanding, prevention and possibly treatment of virus-triggered asthma. The results will enable development of a genetic risk score for long-term asthma development that enables personalised prevention campaigns, which will be developed jointly with patient groups. The molecular mechanisms discovered, and the drug-like compounds that revert the perturbation signatures, will enable development of mechanism-targeted drugs. Fundamentally, the mechanisms identified in this specific model for a strong viral contribution to non-communicable disease will likely represent general mechanisms of how viral infections cause onset and development of other non-communicable diseases.|10.3030/101137201|Cluster Health

PERSIMMON will push the state-of-the-art by providing personalized and biodegradable multimodal smart sensor patches based on low-cost additive manufacturing. The innovations introduced by PERSIMMON rely on new sensor materials, AI, and digital surface mount technology (SMT). The developed patches will be used in multinodal networks with multimodal nodes on the skin for advanced DPHM, with improved sustainability and circularity. Cloud-based AI sensor fusion will be used for blood pressure and body temperature monitoring, and edge-AI for reducing motion artefacts, selecting good signal conditions, and reduce power consumption at the smart patch. In addition, PERSIMMON will develop new sensor materials for biodegradability, sensor electrodes, and nano-MOS embedded in semi-permeable materials (that will allow gas sensors on the skin with both extended lifetime in multiuse modules and at extreme low cost in disposables). Within 48 months and with the involvement of 13 partners from six countries, PERSIMMON will demonstrate remote DPHM in sport use cases of ski mountaineering and swimming, and in continuous remote monitoring of chronically ill patients in their everyday lives. A production line for additive manufacturing of soft and compliant printed wiring boards based on digital SMT manufacturing, and a 5G gateway for body worn IoT will be demonstrated and made as business cases. The used water-soluble biopolymers and liquid metal interconnects and contacts remove microplastics waste and allow for reuse of clean components and recycled metal without high-temperature or toxic processing. Life cycle analysis, societal uptake, acceptance, and compliance to a circular economy are indeed at the methodological basis of the design and development of new devices and of the appliance tests in PERSIMMON.|10.3030/101129713|Cluster 4

The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS, https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu) exploits the information content of Earth-Observation data to monitor the composition of the atmosphere. By combining satellite observations with numerical modelling by means of data assimilation and inversion techniques, CAMS provides in near-real time a wealth of information to answer questions related to air quality, climate change and air pollution and its mitigation, energy, agriculture, etc. CAMS provides both global atmospheric composition products, using the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) of ECMWF - hereafter denoted the global production system - , and regional European products, provided by an ensemble of eleven regional models - the regional production system. The CAMS AERosol Advancement (CAMAERA) project will provide strong improvements of the aerosol modelling capabilities of the regional and global systems, on the assimilation of new sources of data, and on a better representation of secondary aerosols and their precursor gases. In this way CAMAERA will enhance the quality of key products of the CAMS service and therefore help CAMS to better respond to user needs such as air pollutant monitoring, along with the fulfilment of sustainable development goals. To achieve this purpose CAMAERA will develop new prototype service elements of CAMS, beyond the current state-of-art. It will do so in very close collaboration with the CAMS service providers, as well as other tier-3 projects. In particular CAMAERA will complement research topics addressed in CAMEO, which focuses on the preparation for novel satellite data, improvements of the data assimilation and inversion capabilities of the CAMS production system, and the provision of uncertainty information of CAMS products.|10.3030/101134927|Cluster 4

However, the key problem of the industry transition towards climate neutrality is that the combined response of demand, global trade and industrial production to policy measures is highly complex.The aim of the AMIGDALA project is to facilitate decision makers in governments and in the EU’s industries to define and evaluate pathways towards climate neutrality, circularity and sustainability. In this project we combine insights in decision-making with integrated modelling of scenarios to analyze transformation pathways. We analyze decisions-making in government and in industry by the control options that they have such as incentives, regulatory measures and investments in capital projects to contribute to the Green Deal’s objectives. We deliver an integrated model to represent EU industry’s transformation pathways up to 2070 and cover historical developments from 1990. We develop a method to combine established models of separate domains and let them operate as-one. This integrated model shows the combined effect of control options on economy, trade, energy, materials flow, biomass and industrial production on an EU systems-level and within a global context. On a local-level we use models to analyze the decisions by industry clusters to invest in transformative solutions and utility operators to build infrastructure. With the integrated model we run scenarios that we develop on the basis of the control options of decisionmakers to achieve industrial transformation towards climate neutrality. The integrated model allows to analyze the effect of framework conditions on the uptake of transformative solutions and products and on energy demand, emissions, and material use.

Key to the GO-Forward approach is to simulate geological processes for pre-drill assessment of reservoir structure and properties, calibrated to geological or geophysical data, rather than extrapolating the properties from those data with geostatistical methods. To this end, GO-Forward focuses on extending and further developing, testing and demonstrating the added value of forward modelling methods originally developed for hydrocarbon exploration, including stratigraphic forward modelling (SFM), diagenesis forward modelling (DFM) and fracture network forward modelling (FFM), to be used for exploration in different geothermal settings of high relevance for Europe. First, the developed approaches will be tested and calibrated in areas with abundant subsurface information and production data, to prove conceptually the applicability of the methods and reproducibility of the results, to optimise and de-risk geothermal exploration. Calibrated model approaches are subsequently applied in areas with limited data availability to demonstrate their capability to increase pre-drill Probability of Success (POS). To support the workflow and further reduce exploration costs, GO-Forward advances ML-based and computational methods to enhance (existing) (sub)surface information for calibration, uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, and (upscaling) routines for flow simulation, DNSH, and techno-economic performance assessment for POS and Value of Information (VOI).  In addition, GO-Forward addresses public awareness of geothermal developments already at the early stages of exploration. By including novel approaches to citizen engagement and stakeholder dialogue, we aim to increase the societal readiness level of geothermal exploration as the first step of geothermal developments.|10.3030/101147618|Cluster 5

FPV must prove its sustainability, by demonstrating low impact on biodiversity and satisfy end-of-life requirements, its longevity and reliability by demonstrating system components that satisfy structural and functional requirements for the entire lifecycle, and its affordability, by reducing the LCOE from FPV power plants.  These are the challenges that the objectives of SuRE seek to overcome. Activities are structured into 3 generalizable topics, SUstainability, Reliability, and Efficiency, which gives SuRE FPV its name, and are designed to advance the entire FPV industry. We will further work with concrete technology developments for 3 leading European FPV technologies to improve their design, sustainability, cost-competitiveness and application range. The three FPV technology providers are Ciel et Terre (CTI), who have installed 650 MW globally, Zimmermann PV-Steel Group (ZIM), who is dominating the European FPV market, and Sunlit Sea (Sunlit) who is providing a innovative FPV solution for off-shore deployment. CTI has recently prototyped a new floater design, which will be developed and tested in SuRE, first 50 kW, then on 5 MW scale. ZIM aims to expand their technology to higher sea states, and will build a 5 MW based on the developments in floater-, connection- and anchoring- technology in SuRE. Sunlit are about to scale up their FPV technology and see potential for large reductions in cost and CO2 footprint through the activities planned in SuRE. They will build a smaller, but still commercially relevant, pilot of 100 on the Norwegian cost.

Experience from the existing wind farms shows the importance of a proper micrositing of the wind turbines as well their efficient interconnection within the farm. In addition, bringing wind farms together into clusters toward a wind power plant concept might induce long distance negative interaction between the farms, reducing their expected efficiency. This might happen both on- and offshore. The high amount of connected wind power and the expected increase during the coming years, requires that this technology has to be prepared to take a more important role as of its contribution to the reliability and security of the electricity system. The present proposal, WinDTwin, targets to develop and validate an offshore wind farm digital twin (DT) for highly accurate prediction of power production and energy demand of the end user.  The DT will give users tailored access to high-quality information, services, models, scenarios, forecasts, and visualisations, as a central hub for offshore wind decision-makers.

A particular case is represented by the environmental flow (E-flows), which are essential for the conservation of fluvial ecosystems but often force to operate out of design parameters or rather switch off the plants. On the other hand, the impact of HPPs on water quality and biodiversity up- and downstream is enormous and should also be a target for refurbishing actions. In this context, the SHERPA project will develop and validate innovative technologies for refurbishing current HPPs, namely, 1) AM metallic patches and coatings to minimize damage and enhance resistance to cavitation, 2) new strategies to adapt rotational speed depending on the flow range, 3) advanced air injection systems to improve water quality and efficiency; 4) new runner designs adapted to E-flows increasing performance. Modelling, simulation, and monitoring tools will assess the new solutions of the in terms of energy output, flexible operation, cost-effectiveness, and impact on biodiversity. The goal is to expand and/or adapt the operational range of the HPP to include lower flows, without this harming their lifetime, economic viability, and environmental and social impact. In order to meet this objective, the project proposes a methodology comprising 8 work packages groups in four blocks to be carried out during 42 months.SHERPA has a well-balanced consortium with 7 partners from 4 countries, covering all the competences and know-how in terms of expertise, resources and positioning in the field, which will ensure the achievement of the project objectives and make an impact at European level.|10.3030/101172849|Cluster 5

It examines the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the sector and explores policies and strategies in Croatia, Denmark, Estonia, Scotland, and Spain through comparative studies. Utilizing a multidisciplinary approach and mixed methods, the project investigates factors affecting VET student engagement, including demographics and socio-economic backgrounds, by analyzing longitudinal data and conducting in-depth interviews with selected students. This research aims to provide insights into young people's educational paths in post-pandemic Europe, highlighting differences in socio-economic status and educational aspirations, as well as differences between the pre- and post-pandemic cohorts. VETprep’s combination of generalized knowledge and individual narratives will offer a nuanced picture of Youths in the post-pandemic Europe. Furthermore, with a comparative focus on differences across the European Countries and across different young people according to socioeconomic status, academic achievements, etc., we get the opportunity to understand both the consequences and relevant actions in the light of individual differences and varying societal, political, and educational frameworks in the five European countries. The project aims to help policymakers and other stakeholders (a) meet their obligations under the EPSR (everyone has the right to quality and inclusive education, training and lifelong learning, including reducing the NEET rate to 9% by 2030) (b) implement the Council Recommendation on VET for sustainable competitiveness, social fairness and resilience (c) meet the goals of Pathways to School Success, including reducing Early Leaving from Education (d) meet UN SDGs 4, 8, 9 & 10.|10.3030/101177858|Cluster 2

The project innovates on the current state of the art in four ways. First, we challenge existing oversimplifications of far-right ideas on gender, and adopt an intersectional lens exposing their contradictions and complexities where anti-gender hyper-masculine/feminine tropes go alongside pro-gender equality endorsements within anti-immigration campaigns. Second, we concentrate on the youth which is an under-studied group within research on the far-right, and explore the importance of gender for this demographic as a key avenue of identity formation and politicisation. Third, we focus on far-right youth formal leaders at local levels, and new types of leadership such as online influencers. Four, we offer a thorough understanding of how far-right youth ideas on gender impact on democracy by charting how they inform policy debates and become normalised. YOU-DARE will also produce methodological and policy innovation (a) by using qualitative methods to investigate far-right youth leadership; (b) mapping online ‘gender controversies’ engaging far-right youth; (d) overcoming methodological nationalism through a focus on local levels and the creation of a transnational network of researchers, activists and stakeholders and (c) conducting crosscutting comparative analyses across the 8 countries and selected localities. Finally, to maximise impact, YOU-DARE establishes a Policy Lab as a collaborative platform for policy design, recommendation and implementation. Implementation of policy recommendations generated by the project will be sought through the funding of local level pilot-tested solutions seeking to minimise the appeal of far-right ideas on gender among the youth, and thus reduce their impact on democratic values and practices.|10.3030/101178147|Cluster 2

Large scale restoration is increasingly being touted as an effective solution for mitigating against a range of anthropogenic impacts  and is also hypothesised to protect against zoonotic disease spillover. However, little is known about the mechanisms with which restoration may provide this protection. It is commonly assumed that restoration mirrors in reverse the processes that occur during degradation; however, it is likely that this relationship is in fact asymmetric. Rarely can restored landscapes be returned to a state similar to that of pristine ecosystems, and often restored landscapes need to fulfil a range of environmental and socioeconomic requirements that inherently prevent them from doing so. Additionally, the spatiotemporal scale necessary to effect positive change is context dependent, and the type of restoration necessary to protect against zoonotic spillover is currently unknown. Ecosystem restoration can vary widely in type, scale and context and can also change how humans interact with their environment, which may have unexpected consequences for zoonotic disease spillover. Given the complexity of these interactions and their effect on disease, it is vital that we understand how restoration specifically might impact wildlife disease and emergent spillover risk.|10.3030/101134969|Cluster 6

Yet, it also triggers challenges in terms of representation and content exhibition. This becomes particularly pressing in the context of CH of minorities. Overall, this reduces participation and inclusion of minorities, hindering equitable representations of diverse values in digitisation, leading to increased risks of misuse of digital CH. DIGICHer tackles these challenges by providing new understanding on key legal and policy, socio-economic and technological factors governing digitisation of minorities’ CH. Following the citizen science and co-creation approach DIGICHer develops a novel scalable framework and methods to promote equitable, diverse and inclusive practices, verified via user-centric approaches through pilots with three minority groups in the EU: the Sámi, the Jewish and the Ladin people with a further exploitation in other minorities groups. On these bases, it develops recommendations for policy and decision makers, as well as CH institutions, and delivers methods for decision support to monitor the field of digital heritage with specific regards to its diversity long-term.The DIGICHer interdisciplinary consortium will lead to several actions and outcomes that will increase minorities’ involvement in the digitisation and usage of their CH, contributing to a more responsive and democratic cultural sector, whose digital activities reflect the plurality of minorities’ worldviews in Europe. Minority heritage will be represented in a way which respects minorities’ values, ensuring better understanding and enhanced engagement with minority heritage collections by the general public and professional heritage users, leading to more resilient European cultural institutions with a pluralistic offer that is appealing to a diverse future generation of audiences.|10.3030/101132481|Cluster 2

Each year the cost to the EU is ca. 1.9 million lives and ca. €200 billion in health care, informal care and productivity loss for cancers alone. Current live cell imaging tools can only provide a limited view of the in vivo and in vitro microenvironments where diseases originate and grow. The result is a gap in our understanding of the biochemical cellular makeup and how their disturbance leads to disease. By increasing accuracy and speed of imaging and analysis, the gap can be closed allowing novel medical treatments and diagnostics tailored to patients’ specific conditions. uCAIR brings successful R&D photonics SMEs, research laboratories in optics and cell biology, and world-leading microscopists and clinicians to create an innovative, versatile, practical multimodal photonics platform that will enhance and speed up the way cells are examined by scientists and healthcare professionals. uCAIR will achieve breakthrough results by developing a laser platform that inventively combines non-linear optical fibers, optronics, wide-band coherent Raman and artificial intelligence technologies to image at video rates and track cells and biological tissues with augmented chemometric digitalisation. The new coherent light sources will be suitable for fundamental research microscopes and microfluidic channels but also in medical imaging instruments, encompassing a value chain for new biomarker discoveries and translation into medical endoscopy, for example during cystoscopy and resection of bladder cancer. Technology progression to TRL 6 will allow first mover advantage with sustainable supply chain.

Broad spectrum host-directed antiviral drugs (HDA) are promising therapeutic options, however the robust identification of relevant host factors by genome-wide knockout screens is challenging due to low consistency in the resulting hits. Our project aims to (1) establish a computational and experimental pipeline to identify and validate an antiviral for these viruses, and (2) identify at least one broad spectrum antiviral drug against potential emerging and re-emerging viruses as listed by the WHO. To address these, we will implement a drug selection pipeline following several strategies: We will employ (i)  machine learning, based on data from knockout screens, proteomics, protein interaction, transcriptomics of infected cells with pandemic-related viruses, Genome-Wide Association Studies, and generic gene descriptors, (ii) High Density Cell Arrays, which provide much more detailed readouts compared to state of the art pooled knockout screens, (iii)  primary cell cultures obtained from a diverse array of human tissues, as they are more appropriate to study the host cell physiology during infection, compared to cancer cell lines, and (iv) use the pipeline to identify host restriction factors, which, when activated, challenge the virus; followed by innovative drug development and delivery based on small activating RNA. The pipeline comprises an Expedited Arm for which broad spectrum antiviral drugs for repurposing will be selected followed by in vitro and in vivo efficacy testing, and a clinical trial as a proof of concept. The elaborated Arm includes all strategies (i)-(iv) and will provide a sustainable pandemic preparedness pipeline ready-to-operate to identify the appropriate treatment against the emerging virus at the early time of a new outbreak.|10.3030/101137311|Cluster Health

ENDOMIX will tackle this challenge by revealing associations and causality between EDCs and adverse health outcomes by focusing on exposure to multiple EDCs during life course including windows of susceptibility and making use of already existing robust data from multiple European cohorts. Modelling how real-life EDC mixtures target the immune system to initiate, trigger or perpetuate diseases combined with high throughput bioassays will reveal health-relevant mixtures of concern whose impact will be studied using ground-breaking methodology while delivering valuable information on mechanistic pathways and transgenerational impact of exposure to EDCs. This strategy will lead to the identification of biomarkers and patterns of exposure that are easy to measure, available for big sample sizes, and indicative of health endpoints. Finally, we will provide evidence synthesis of in vitro, in silico and in vivo data for strengthening causal inference and use a weight of evidence approach to generate artificial intelligence-assisted knowledge graphs.This unique loop approach with a novel focus on the immune system as EDC target is only made possible by the consortium’s interdisciplinary expertise and extensive access to existing data and biosamples as well as a meticulous study design.

The consortium sees food cultures as a “living heritage” that reflects changes in society and contributes to local well-being with wide-reaching impacts. CONVIVIUM mobilizes numerous creative and transformative forces in the fields that inform the New European Bauhaus to ensure sustainability and positive societal transformation through the medium of food heritage. It offers attractive and sustainable cultural-based solutions which will bring about a range of cultural and economic applications available to different target groups. They include architecture-and-design-based prototypes that will support farmers and agricultural cooperatives to work in symbiosis with the environment, with tradition, and with state-of-the art advances; cultural events and interventions that bring food, the arts, and the humanities together to positively change the mindsets of food producers and consumers; new organizational models that champions inter-cultural, generational, and intersectional visions through the medium of food across local populations; and digital tools to reinforce the presence of food heritage in institutions such as museums and historical sites. CONVIVIUM will achieve this commitment supported by solid managerial, scientific, collaborative, and technical structures, which are in constant dialogue to ensure that the unlocking of food heritage translates into solutions grounded in the needs and opportunities of local communities, in state-of-the-art social science and humanities approaches and methods, and in synergies between traditional crafts and cutting-edge technological developments.|10.3030/101178921|Cluster 2

The combination of in-depth case studies and broad analyses of European economies using a rich variety of data sources ranging from survey and administrative data to big data provides highly valuable complementary insights into the nature of shortages, their drivers and pathways out. The indicators created are transparent and easily accessible. The analyses of drivers and pathways are conducted both for all European countries and for particularly relevant example countries.To validate the quantitative analyses, to explore mechanisms and to identify particularly promising pathways, we engage in extensive consultations and set up feedback loops with the research community, especially with relevant international and national research initiatives, and with stakeholders. The stakeholder consultations help to develop concrete policy proposals aimed at a thriving economy and an inclusive society. To maximise SkilMeeT’s impact, we disseminate the project’s indicators and insights, as well as concrete policy proposals to policymakers, stakeholders and the public.|10.3030/101132581|Cluster 2

HARP is designed to foster actionable, inclusive, and emotionally-engaging CCE strategies to promote climate change mitigation. Masaryk University, renowned for its focus on climate change education, acknowledges the need for a quantitative approach to CCE, expertise currently excelling at Utrecht University with specialists like Boeve-de Pauw Jelle and a mixed method found in Vienna with the likes of Andrea Moeller.HARP identifies the uneven state of CCE in Europe, often fragmented and insufficiently integrated into national curricula. Its objective is to transform CCE into a primary driver for climate action, making CCE more holistic by incorporating various disciplinary perspectives. The project is designed to offer actionable recommendations, ultimately aiming to cultivate a climate-literate populace pivotal for the imminent climate challenges. Acknowledging that existing CCE often overlooks the emotional dynamics of climate change, which significantly influences action engagement, HARP promotes a comprehensive approach to CCE (source). The initiative targets two primary objectives. Firstly, enhancing the capacities of partner institutions for Climate Change Education Research (CCER), emphasizing strengthening research design and improving the overall CCER quality across Europe. Secondly, the formation of a European CCE and CCER network to bolster collaboration and share findings, complemented by national and international advisory boards. In sum, HARP's intent is to uplift the quality, breadth, and influence of CCE, enabling a community of learners, educators, and researchers equipped to significantly contribute to climate change mitigation.|10.3030/101160082|Other

Europe’s game developers are a vital cultural and creative industry whose capacity to meet climate goals must be achieved as a matter of urgency. The size, energy and resource intensive nature of game development means that these industries are key contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and ecological destruction. There are over 4,900 video game developer studios in Europe, employing 98,000 people, with a combined revenue of €23.3bn. Although smaller in size, Europe’s board game industry is also a significant CCI, with revenues projected to reach $4 billion by 2023.  Analogue and video game developers share expertise, creative practices, and workers, and can support one another to meet challenges and take up opportunities. In video and analogue game development, micro and small enterprises represent over 90% of the industries. The fact that most developers are micro enterprises presents specific challenges in their climate transition. However, game developers are also first movers among Europe’s CCIs, paving the way in green technological developments and business innovation. Furthermore, game development requires innovative design practices that can be harnessed to drive an inclusive societal climate transition. This project not only addresses the challenges faced by the industries, then, but seizes on the opportunities for game developers, and on the unprecedented reach of games among European citizens, recognizing the role of bottom-up behaviour change as key to the success of policy aimed at societal transformation.|10.3030/101132538|Cluster 2

Climate change (CG) is widely recognised as one of the most impactful global changes, and since it goes hand-by-hand with biodiversity and services loss in terrestrial ecosystems, they should be tackled together. Microbes constitute the life support system of the biosphere, but they are its most overlooked fraction and are not considered in the context of CG. The overall understanding of the impact of CG on the assembly and functions of microbiomes is still very limited. How the complex microbes-plants-soil interactions and its consequences on plant performance and productivity are impacted by CG is still largely unknown. Additional knowledge also needs to be obtained on the overall ecosystem functioning, and to what extent microbiomes may mitigate stress conditions due to CG. The project MICROBES-4-CLIMATE will provide a wider community of users/researchers, irrespective of location, efficient access to a cluster of complementary world-class Research Infrastructures and their integrated, advanced services along with training and scientific and/or technical support, to address such need. An excellence-driven programme of Transnational Access, which is at the core of the project, will enable users to conduct curiosity-driven research addressing terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystems, in light of the abovementioned multidimensional and still poorly understood microbiomes-plants-soil-environment interactions, and its roles in CG responses, resilience, and mitigation. This will foster the advancement of frontier knowledge and also pave the way to applied research on harnessing plant-microbiome interactions to improve the climate resiliency of plants/crops and to enable e.g., precision, sustainable and resilient agriculture.|10.3030/101131818|Other

Each domain will be covered by a specific work package (WP1-4) with methodologies linked to two axes: Axis 1 respecting to CCH: changes, reactions and representations and Axis 2 to promoting confidence in changes in CCH. Four small scale pilot trials will be carried out – one per domain – in different European countries to test the effectiveness (assumptions and applications) of the four proposed methods in fostering confidence in CCH changes across the diversity of Europe.THEIR RELEVANCE TO THE WORK PROGRAMME: The accomplishment of these objectives will allow CONCILIARE to meet the two envisaged expected outcomes of contributing to a “deeper and broader understanding of the constantly changing nature of cultural heritage and of how this understanding can be effectively shared by citizens” and to the “the development of evidence-based methods, tested in small scale, to help citizens face current and future societal transformations with greater confidence”.|10.3030/101132582|Cluster 2

In a context of human-driven global changes, these threats will intensify with larger and more frequent epidemics, potentially leading to pandemics, will expand with geographic spreading of the mosquito vectors, and will multiply with the likely emergence of yet-unknown flaviviruses. Improving pandemic preparedness and response to these emerging and re-emerging diseases is a top priority both for the EU and WHO. However, there are no effective interventions against all flaviviruses and current vaccines targeting flaviviral proteins have severe safety issues. FLAVIVACCINE’s high-impact/low-risk/disruptive ambition is to develop a novel, broad-spectrum, mosquito saliva-targeted vaccine candidate that protects against multiple different flaviviruses and is ready for clinical evaluation by building upon an experimentally-validated proof-of-concept. FLAVIVACCINE will define the immunogenicity of the pan-flavivirus target, develop and characterize a vaccine candidate against multiple flaviviruses, and prepare it for clinical evaluation. To reach these goals, FLAVIVACCINE creates a unique interdisciplinary environment of ten public and private institutions, including Universities, Research Institutions and a Vaccine Developer, from seven countries to cover all the required scientific expertise and knowledge in cell biology, virology, immunology and vaccinology. The pan-flavivirus vaccine candidate that will be validated against dengue, yellow fever, Zika and West Nile diseases in several preclinical models, together with the knowledge and networks resulting from FLAVIVACCINE, will have short- and long-term impact on the EU ability to combat epidemic and pandemic viral threats, and protect communities and citizens in the EU and around the world.|10.3030/101137006|Cluster Health

Central to achieving this goal is the development and validation of the IMP>ACT assessment framework for users in policy and practice.SCCE is still relatively new in the EU context. There is still a lack of understanding of what effective SCCE looks like and how its impact can be measured. As a result, an evidence base to inform decisions for further development of programs and policies is still lacking. Existing evidence is scattered across scientific fields and societal actors, often resulting in underutilised feedback loops between monitoring, evaluation and implementation. These gaps hinder effective policy making and achievement of SCCE learning outcomes.At the core of the IMP>ACT assessment framework are the concepts of action competence (key observable learning outcome of SCCE) and action-orientation (key qualities of teaching, driving learning in SCCE). IMP>ACT will design and validate the framework in a user-centred, iterative approach through small-scale interventions, followed by six large-scale case studies, selected to cover the lifelong learning scope of SCCE. IMP>ACT brings together an interdisciplinary consortium with partners from SCCE research, policy and practice. In each country a national stakeholder group (35 committed organisations) actively co-develops and validates the IMP>ACTassessment framework, contributing to its validity and viability beyond the project’s lifetime.The IMP>ACT assessment framework will allow designers and implementers of SCCE policies, curricula and practices to collect information on the impact they achieve, and as such drive improved feedback loops between research, policy and practice.

EXPOSIGNALZ project aims to delineate the impact of a selection of environmental pollutants on brain health throughout life and their role in dementia especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD) representing about 70% of dementia cases. Through interdisciplinary approaches, integrating experimental and epidemiological studies, our objectives are to: 1) Identify environmental pollutants likely to have neurotoxic effects and pro-amyloidogenic properties predictive of a neurodegenerative trajectory related to AD using in vitro screening models; 2) Characterize pollutant signatures associated with brain aging and AD in biological matrices of 4 European population-based cohorts of various age groups; 3) Understand the mechanisms of action of pollutants identified in the in vitro screenings and those found in biological signatures, using AD-iPSC and AD preclinical models; 4) Explore the impact of pollutants on early neurodevelopment as a factor of susceptibility for later neurodegenerative diseases using brain organoids and gestational contamination models and 5) Disseminate knowledge to policy makers, to the relevant stakeholders and general public in order to define guidelines for disease prevention and take actions for population’s health. The project, which aims to identify chemical pollutants as new risk factors  for dementia as well as  new pollutant-associated biomarkers, could contribute to: (i) reduce or delay the incidence of AD, and thus reduce the economic and social burden; and (ii) allow an earlier diagnosis of AD combined with new disease modifying treatments to delay the entrance of patients in the more severe stages of the pathology.|10.3030/101156353|Cluster Health

For each virus family with epidemic/pandemic potential, stockpiles of potent drugs are needed that can be deployed when a new pathogen emerges. Such broader-acting drugs (targeting conserved viral functions) are needed as of “day one” of an outbreak, for treatment and prophylaxis (e.g., in HCW and frail patients). In combination with quarantine measures, such drugs will delay (global) spread, allowing time for vaccine-development. Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, PANVIPREP’s core partners have successfully collaborated in leading European antiviral drug research projects. This provides a solid scientific basis in combination with translational drug discovery expertise. The team includes virologists, biochemists, structural biologists, medicinal chemists and pharmacokinetics experts. Previously developed know-how and toolboxes will be a major asset to achieve immediate impact. PANVIPREP aims to greatly expand the antiviral portfolio and identify novel druggable targets of high-risk RNA viruses. Hits will be identified through (i) phenotypic antiviral screening of compound libraries (ii) structure-based drug design, (iii) in silico screening, supported by the latest machine-learning methods. We will deliver 25 to 50 high-quality, broad(er)-spectrum (pan-genus/pan-family) hit molecules/hit series. Two of these will be developed to the early lead stage, including proof of concept in animal infection models. Remaining hits will serve as chemical tool-compounds to explore mechanisms of action thereby identifying novel druggable targets in RNA virus replication. This in turn will accelerate target-based drug design efforts.

With a 25% prevalence in the general population, MASLD is currently the most common liver disease, and a major healthcare and economic burden. While hyperlipidaemia, obesity and insulin resistance are the major risk factors for MASLD and contribute to its rising prevalence, growing evidence suggests that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can initiate and/or cause progression of MASLD. EDC-MASLD will focus on investigating the impact of environmental exposure to EDCs on the internal exposome (metabolome, gut microbiome, epigenome, proteome, immunome) and degree of liver damage in MASLD in prospective study settings, with a focus on the period of transition to progressive stages of MASLD. EDC-MASLD is particularly focused on interactions between EDC exposure, sex, genotype, diet, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, via the data and biosamples available in the unique European NAFLD Registry, comprising over 9,000 patients with histologically characterised MASLD.

EFFEct has four interrelated objectives. Objective 1 offers novel insights on diversity, equity and inclusion by investigating targeted programs for disadvantaged students as well as religious and elite schools. Objective 2 investigates how teacher shortages can be mitigated and examines the role of digital environments. Objective 3 evaluates policies related to instruction, admission standards, and upskilling and reskilling of adults. Finally, objective 4 analyzes how the efficiency of EU educational systems has changed since the COVID-19 pandemic and establishes the main policy levers and qualitative insights that may explain efficiency changes. EFFEct brings together a multidisciplinary research team of economists, sociologists, (neuro-)psychologists, teacher trainers, education scientists, mathematicians, and sustainability and operational research experts from four European research universities, a research institute and a NGO.|10.3030/101129146|Cluster 2

Polyethylene (PE) is the most widely used and the largest-volume plastic (c.a. 30% of total plastics). Due to the absence of reactive groups, the C-C backboned plastics are often categorized as non-degradable; generally disposed by incineration or landfill (67%). About 12% plastic wastes are recycled as the goods with inferior quality and performance. The real catalytic route for upcycling of PE wastes into value-added products is <1%. It is clear that there is an urgent need to develop new routes for innovative upcycling of plastic wastes towards a paradigm shift in the plastic economy.  ACTPAC proposes a complete value-added industry-viable path to convert PE firstly into alkanes; then into high-value chemicals (monomers); and finally into PE-like but fully biodegradable polyesters. Beyond the state-of-the art technologies, ACTPAC will design and deploy new catalysts and cross-metathesis modes for highly active and selective metathesis of PE into linear alkanes with a narrow distribution range (C6-C18, >90%). Two separate systems: multi-enzyme machinery assembled in the recombinant cells, and metabolic engineered yeast system, dedicated to the transformation of alkanes into monomers will be developed. Monomers of diversified chain-lengths will be used for the synthesis of polyesters presenting different properties and polymer performances, assignable for various applications. A zero-waste solution to the plastic waste management is thus created to keep them out of the environment, and reclaim their values. The new properties and  specific applications of the new polyester plastics produced from upcycling of PE waste will bring up the SMEs with new business opportunities by scalable, flexible and robust multi-product manufacturing processes for on-demand and small-volume output production.|10.3030/101135289|Cluster 6

However, due to primary or secondary resistance, only a minority of patients show long term responses, leading to exploration of a multiplicity of new agents and combinatorial strategies. Due to lack of biomarkers that can predict response, many patients are submitted to treatments that will not have clinical benefit. A thorough understanding of the biological processes causing resistance to immunotherapy in NSCLC could facilitate informed personalised therapy choices. This requires a multifactorial assessment of the tumour microenvironment, a complex and dynamic milieu, encompassing the majority of tumour-host interactions. SPACETIME brings together interdisciplinary expertise to achieve a superior understanding of the spatial and temporal tumour-host co-evolution, and drive translation into predictive biomarkers for precision immunotherapy. We will integrate spatial proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics and glycomics to analyse patient biopsies from early stage to metastatic disease, complemented with tissues from representative mouse models to cover the developments early after tumour initiation. Environmental and systemic factors that may influence this co-evolutionary process will be included to identify potential risk factors for therapy resistance. Ex-vivo, in vitro and in vivo assays will bring functional understanding of immune resistance mechanisms and identify key cellular interactions and therapeutic targets. This will be brought together by advanced computational approaches, to define spatial signatures, that will lead to a limited panel of potential prognostic and/or predictive markers for immunotherapy. Supported by engagement of key stakeholders, SPACETIME will pave the way towards development of a spatial signature test for patient stratification, to sidestep immunotherapy resistance and improve survival for NSCLC patients.This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on “Understanding (tumour-host interactions)”.|10.3030/101136552|Cluster MISS

Exposure to such materials may occur as a result of their intended use (e.g., food packaging) or at the end of their lifecycle (e.g. plastic wear). These services, which are relevant to several areas of important societal and economic impact, are expected to span multiple scales and disciplines, including high-quality metrology, structural biology, microbiology, and ecotoxicology.The main output of this proposal will be a thorough overview of extant service offer by European RIs with respect to questions from state-of-the-art of scientific research in the aforementioned domains. FHERITALE will identify common strategies for the coordination and optimization of services at different RIs geared towards increasing the accessibility of relevant technologies. In parallel, it will identifty those service and technology gaps that are hampering high-impact research and preventing a timely assessment of the repercussions of new materials on health and the environment. These gaps constitute high-priority areas for future development. FHERITALE will design a coordination framework for the RIs to drive these key technological developments.The technological focus of this application includes emerging areas of research for which international interest is rapidly growing. The interdisciplinary nature of the cluster of identified technologies will connect health, food, and environment research, constituting one of the first examples of practical application of the “One Health” approach. This coordination effort will also serve as a fertile ground for further interdisciplinary research among RIs from the H&F and other domains.|10.3030/101131588|Other

At its core lies the recognition that emotions play a fundamental role in political participation and communication. Understanding and responding to citizens' emotional (re)actions - as set up by CIDAPE's inquiry -  are essential to achieving coordinated, democratic action.With a focus on the perceived and articulated emotions around climate and inequality, CIDAPE proposes a comprehensive, multi-methods approach and multidisciplinary analysis of the force of political emotions in European politics of climate change. The project's WPs delve into emotions in the political sphere, media, everyday life, global-local entanglements, social movements, and citizen engagement showing how emotions shape people's rational argumentation, engagement, and ultimately, who and what they care about.CIDAPE seeks to uncover the core mechanisms and processes at the heart of political action - at the policy, polity, and politics levels - and proposes participatory tools, policy instruments, and methodological guides to address these challenges. The project emphasizes that the climate crisis provides a unique opportunity to unite citizens across the political spectrum and that the success of coordinated democratic action will require high levels of public trust, strong institutions, and policies that resonate with citizens' political emotions. the Consortium assembles experienced researchers from political science, sociology, linguistics, communication science, and international relations, and distinguished representatives from civil society across nine European countries.

To this end, P2F will integrate information from paleoenvironmental  proxy data, from Earth system models (ESMs), and from rigorous theoretical approaches. Being able to reconstruct past climate evolution is a necessary step for enhancing our capacity to look into the future and, therefore, extensive improvements of state-of-the-art ESMs are needed. So far, ESMs are mainly calibrated and validated with respect to the instrumental records of the last ~170 years of relatively stable climate, while the Earth’s longer-term history is characterised by an interplay of gradual climate change, variability and critical transitions between competing states, with profound impacts on climate subsystems, ecosystems, and civilisations. Understanding the leading dynamical processes and feedbacks and in particular improving our ability to model and anticipate critical transitions in the climate and ecosystems is key to project future climate change on spatio-temporal scales relevant for societies, ecosystems and the planet. In this context, P2F will critically advance our ability to understand and anticipate the main climatic and societal impacts of the ongoing climate crisis. Specifically, P2F will extend the reach of Earth System Models and demonstrate a step change in the model development cycle of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), by providing fully paleo-informed models for future projection and producing a portfolio of plausible future climate change scenarios that are constrained by documented past climate changes and abrupt transitions. Finally, P2F will efficiently disseminate research outputs and engage key stakeholders in dialogue to ensure appropriate synergies are at attained.|10.3030/101184070|Cluster 5

To achieve this, ESCIB will develop assessment methodologies and thus contribute to the standardisation of such methodologies. The aim is to develop a comprehensive, robust and fully operational methodology to assess the sustainability of bio-based systems at various technology-readiness levels (TRLs). This methodology is based on a holistic life-cycle approach to evaluate the environmental impacts and circularity along bio-based value chains. Potential socio-economic trade-offs will be addressed and included in the methodology. ESCIB’s integrated way of analysing environmental and circularity impacts along bio-based value chains is also fully in line with the ambition of the European Green Deal (EGD) and the Circular Economy Action Plan (CEAP). With the involvement of five innovative industry partners in the consortium, which produce bio-based products in different sectors, ESCIB will ensure high applicability of the method which can be used by certification organisations to label and certify products for the benefit of consumers and society.

This innovative approach is based on the well-established Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus approach, which emphasizes the primacy of ensuring water security when designing, installing and managing agroforestry systems.  The translation of this conceptual agroforestry management approach into real-world applications is supported by an array of technical and non-technical innovations. These include cutting-edge measurement methods and tools to accurately assess environmental and socio-economic impacts, scalable nature-based intervention strategies to facilitate sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and novel business models designed to secure long-term livelihoods of local communities engaged in agroforestry practices.  The efficacy of the novel approach and supporting innovations will be rigorously tested and validated through a series of large-scale pilot demonstrations set to take place in key locations across Africa, including Tunisia, Ghana, and Ethiopia. Novel community-led engagement methods are used to support the co-design of the demonstrators, and ensure deep acceptance of the innovation within local communities.  Expected outcomes will contribute to bridging the agroforestry data gaps in Africa, increased crop yield, doubling of farmers’ annual incomes, and creation of new carbon sinks across previously degraded territories. An ambitious post-project exploitation plan executed in partnership with EU and African policymakers and civil society groups foresees the immediate and widespread uptake of resulting innovations across African Union (AU) member countries and beyond by 2030.  Innovation adopters will significantly enhance their communities’ resilience to threats posed by the climate emergency, and stimulate highly sustainable socio-economic development across their region.|10.3030/101182176|Cluster 6

The ARISE project envisions a near future which aligns with the principles of Industry 5.0, prioritising resilient, sustainable, and human-centric work environments. In such a future, companies recognise that investing in industrial human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential for achieving better short- and long-term goals, rather than a cost. Human-centric approaches surpass traditional technology-driven approaches, with technology serving people rather than the other way around. Industrial HRI establishes its position as a game-changing asset that enables seamless collaboration between humans and robots on complex tasks, allowing them to work together in shifts of any length. On its way to materialise such a vision, the ARISE project will i) address major application challenges from today’s industry, ii) develop human-centric solutions, tools, and software modules which expand the state-of-the-art in industrial HRI, and iii) deploy industrial HRI at scale in four testing and experimentation facilities and more than 25 workplaces across Europe (FSTP Projects). The ARISE project will address these challenges using cutting-edge open-source technologies from the European innovation ecosystem and will make a significant adavance on their state-of-the-art to position Europe globally at the forefront of industrial HRI. To that aim, the project will put the focus on the achievement of four major goals: (1) to increase the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of developing, deploying, and maintaining HRI solutions; (2) To develop open-source based reusabmodules which push industrial HRI beyond the SotA; (3) to demonstrate openness and agility as crucial enablers of truly valuable and sustainable HRI solutions; (4) to ensure impact a and sustainability through a critical mass of stakeholders & strong liaisons with ADRA ecosystem.|10.3030/101135784|Cluster 4

This has brought to an ageing phenomenon, as well as the emergence of several structural problems such as fewer job opportunities, degradation of infrastructures and a decreasing offer of services of general interest. However, the revolution in digitalisation with an increase of remote and location-free work opportunities is offering the chance to redirect some rural migration flows back. Interventions are thus needed to take up this opportunity and build on trends such as multi-local living to promote new greener, smaller, sustainable and innovative growth models. It is there where SMART ERA intervenes. The project will foster resilience in rural areas, by upgrading and co-designing, co-developing and co-validating with local communities a set of smart solutions, integrated within Smart Innovation Packages (SIPs) able to tackle pressing socio-economic and environmental challenges and promote a community-led transition pathway that will empower rural people to act for change. SMART ERA’s main ambitions are: a) building the first large-scale European-wide solution for systematic rural data screening and smartness analysis; b) using co-design methods and techniques to involve residents and stakeholders in the design and validation of SIPs, as well as in the collection of old and creation of new data sources; c) proposing a unified Smartness/Digital Maturity assessment method; d) providing unique and timely evidence-based and performance-focused recommendations to upgrade the new local, national and European policy instruments and enhance their efficiency and efficacy in supporting smart villages across the EU; e) fostering cooperation among pilot regions, as well as among the four EU macro-regional strategies and improve their rural communities’ ability to address socio-economic and environmental challenges.|10.3030/101084160|Cluster 6

It has been designed to meet the three main research outcomes of the work programme topic: the ToC methodology and SROI framework for cultural literacies will directly increase our understanding of the value of cultural literacy on social cohesion; the evidencing of value in arts-based education and the collaborative pedagogy practices in cultural literacy through the co-creation of communities of practice (COPs) and a professional development programme (PDP) for arts educators will support the targeted commissioning of activities that will increase cultural literacy in Europe; and the innovative methodology for data gathering (and engaging) through emotional cartography allows young people to find a voice through more effective initiatives to foster cultural literacy around European cultures.|10.3030/101132285|Cluster 2

Nevertheless, even the most modern NMR spectrometers still employ the same principles as 80 years ago, induction coils and high magnetic fields, making them bulky, expensive, and inaccessible to many potential users. However, a novel type of NMR sensor emerged recently from solid-state spin quantum systems: the nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond, which has demonstrated unparalleled sensitivities in detecting NMR signals. In this proposal, we aim to significantly enhance the sensitivity of modern benchtop NMR spectrometers by several orders of magnitude. We will achieve this improvement by combining the NMR technology field with cutting-edge quantum sensing, employing improved NV-diamond materials, advanced microwave antennas, novel pulse sequences, and quantum control protocols. The goal is to achieve complete control and protection from the environmental noise of the NV-spin state, incorporating quantum memories and logical operations to reach radiofrequency sensitivities well beyond those of classical NMR sensors. The quantum-enhanced benchtop NMR spectrometer will be applied and validated in an analytical chemistry lab environment to demonstrate record sensitivities in molecular analysis enabled by quantum technology, with potential applications in quality control, environmental monitoring, medical diagnostics, online monitoring of chemical reactors, and materials discovery.|10.3030/101135742|Cluster 4

In view of the possible irreversibility associated with such events and the potentially catastrophic global consequences on climate, ecosystems, and society, the precautionary principle demands thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms, compound or cascading impacts, and associated risks. ClimTip will substantially advance the process understanding of possible Earth system Tipping Elements (TEs). It will provide the methodological framework for characterising and constraining potential TEs from paleoclimate, observational and model data, for identifying unknown tipping potential from observations and models, and for quantifying resilience and changes thereof in climate and ecosystems, including early-warning of forthcoming transitions. Earth system models (ESMs) are the primary tool for projecting the risk of large-scale tipping events and ClimTip will substantially improve their representation of suggested TEs. This will enable the identification of safe operating spaces for a stable Earth system by characterising key Earth system TEs in terms of their critical thresholds and rates, hysteresis and overshoot potential via empirical data and ESMs, taking into account the associated uncertainties. As a unique climate service, ClimTip will provide global high-resolution bias-corrected climate fields for large-scale tipping events based on storylines of tipping in comprehensive ESMs. The associated impacts on climate, ecosystems, biodiversity, agriculture, society and economy will be assessed globally and put in relation with the Paris Agreement and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030. ClimTip will deliver a comprehensive and precise knowledge basis for tipping-aware risk assessment and adaptation and mitigation strategies.

To achieve this growth requires FOW to be economic, sustainable and supported by a wide supply chain. TAILWIND is focussed on station-keeping systems of FOW, which comprise mooring lines and anchoring systems. The project will unlock identified opportunities for cost reduction, reduced environmental impact and material use, and also supply chain diversification.TAILWIND will integrate new experimental evidence, novel technologies and innovative methodologies, across mooring lines and anchors, and will quantify the resulting benefits for the overall floating system design. All innovations will be sustainable-by-design, integrating environmental, societal and economic benefits. For mooring lines, new synthetic rope technologies will be mechanically and chemically tested to demonstrate their suitability for small-footprint ‘taut’ moorings, validating new response models. For anchoring, geotechnical centrifuge testing and advanced soil element testing will underpin two advances: (i) new response models for the long-term loading particular to FOW, and (ii) the validation of novel anchors types including cluster anchors that are “silently” installed from small vessels and are suited to shared moorings. The new technologies for mooring lines and anchors will allow smaller and lighter station-keeping systems, manufactured and installed by a wider supply chain.

Globally, the aviation industry aims for a 50% reduction of its carbon emissions by 2050, relative to 2005. In this transition towards net zero carbon emissions, novel powertrain technologies exploiting fuel cells and/or combustion systems that rely on hydrogen will play a significant role. TRIATHLON will use the synergy between powertrain components to overcome the challenges associated with scaling up hydrogen powertrain technology to MW class. The ambition of TRIATHLON is the development of disruptive approaches to design more robust, low-maintenance, low-emmision, highly responsive hydrogen-electric powertrains for megawatt class aircraft. When the distruptive technologies developed by TRIATHLON are adopted by the industry beyond TRIATHLON, it will lead to: 1)Reduction of emissions by implementation of NOx reduction strategies like injection of exhaust water of the FC into the CC and by capturing vented and permeated hydrogen and recompressing it;2)Elimination of the need for a cryogenic pump by using a high-pressure storage buffer for pressurisation of the fuel distribution system (making the fuel distribution more robust for turbulence as well);3)Reduction of the power required for hydrogen conditioning using excess heat from FC and CC by means of 3D printed heat exchangers using innovative materials like ceramics, and smart thermal management;4)Improvement of the gravimetric index of the entire powertrain by providing an effective heatsink to powertrain components, reducing the need for coolant, allowing design of a more compact and lightweight CC, as well as the need for insulation of the hydrogen storage whilst enabling a longer dormancy time.|10.3030/101138960|Cluster 5

Our recent breakthrough in making robust and scalable hydrogenases, Nature's highly active catalyst for H2 oxidation and H2 production, opens the possibility to meet the industrial requirements in terms of i) compatibility with biocatalysis, ii) circular chemistry, and iii) economic and technical competitiveness over fossil-sourced reactants. The overarching aim of CirculH2 is to demonstrate the successful development of one or more highly robust and scalable hydrogenases for use of H2 that selectively drives biotransformations of bio-based materials to specialty and commodity chemicals in an industrial environment (TRL6). Modelling of the reaction processes and lifecycle assessment will deliver a full quantitative evaluation of the performances and applicability of the hydrogenase-biotransformation systems. This will provide convincing evidence for the adoption in industry.

To achieve this goal, the most critical locations in these structures will be investigated: the welded joints and in particular the HAZ. Future green steels will be manufactured using an increased amount of scrap, likely of lower quality and containing higher concentrations of residual elements (Cu, Ni, Cr, Mo, Sn, As, Sb, Pb, Zn, Bi and Co). This will modify the chemical composition of the steel grades and thus the response of the material to thermal cycles, such as imposed by welding. The properties of welded joints will therefore be changed, making it necessary to assess these changes and remedy them, if required. The proposal will investigate modified alloying concepts for the safe application of clean steel in downstream processing and fabrication. It is planned to investigate the application of multiple welding repairs to allow re-use of fabricated components and give the opportunity to have steel solutions with improved CO2 emissions through re-use of fabricated components.The improved or non-degraded weldability will allow to develop new clean steel grades with improved in-use properties, particularly strength and toughness in the welded conditions, through application of state-of-the-art techniques: machine learning, thermodynamic simulations, FEM of microstructural behaviour, supported by advanced analytical techniques.

This poses enormous challenges, especially for the energy-intensive process and production industry, as this industry accounts for one third of total energy consumption. What is needed is intelligent electrification across all operational processes. Electrification has such a large potential impact on decarbonisation because it allows clean, renewable electricity to power processes that previously used emissions-intensive technologies (such as gas burners). This means that a process that previously produced high emissions can become absolutely emission-free when powered by renewable energy.The aim of the CITADEL project is to substitute fossil combustion processes with innovative electric technologies, such as electric resistance heating, microwave heating and plasma heating. Five use cases are considered, targeting the production of refractory bricks, glass and copper wires, preheating processes in steel production and the recycling of concrete. For these specific applications, appropriate demonstration plants have to be designed, built, tested close to the process and validated. This is supported by corresponding activities to provide suitable high-temperature materials and tools for instrumentation and effective process control. Challenges regarding a stable energy supply, electrical and thermal load management or intelligent energy management are simulated by means of numerical models. This includes corresponding risk assessments, e.g. with regard to possible time constraints in terms of a continuous power supply and the consequences of supply fluctuations for process safety. All demonstration cases will be evaluated by a life cycle analysis and with regard to the effectiveness in the reduction of greenhouse gases. The impact of the technical solutions developed here for the process industry will be assessed and strategies for scale-up and deployment will be elaborated.|10.3030/101138794|Cluster 4

Ultimately, FLOATFARM aims to decrease negative environmental impacts on marine life and to enhance the public acceptability of FOW, thereby accelerating the EU energy transition.To this end, a number of critical technologies have been identified as key catalysts. They apply to different conceptual scales, from individual floating offshore wind turbine level (Action 1) to farm level (Action 2) and environmental and socio-economic perspectives (Action 3). Innovations will be introduced into: 1) ROTOR TECHNOLOGY, where innovative rotor designs for improved energy capture will be explored in a co-design approach with innovative control techniques, improved floaters, and a groundbreaking generator concept; 2) MOORING AND ANCHORING, where shared mooring and innovative dynamic cabling will be investigated; 3) WIND FARM CONTROL, where novel control strategies will be exploited to increase the farm power density, and  4) ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT MITIGATION, where marine noise emissions and impacts on marine species of FOW farms will be addressed, innovative artificial reefs will be pioneered and social acceptance will be studied.To ensure that effective solutions are pursued and TRL5 can be achieved, FLOATFARM adopts a holistic approach that combines innovative designs, experimental demonstration at laboratory scale, modelling with a suite of beyond state-of-the-art numerical tools, and demonstration in a unique open-sea laboratory, where a new 1:7 scale 15MW FOWT will be tested in combination with novel floaters, moorings and controls, ensuring systematic assessment and validation that are thus far unprecedented in FOWT research.|10.3030/101136091|Cluster 5

However, the harsh and challenging conditions such as accessibility, environmental hazards, ineffective or inaccurate sampling techniques, and poor bioprospecting pose significant obstacles to their exploration and sampling. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for unlocking the potential of extremophiles to benefit society. The EXPLORA project will depart from two extreme aquatic ecosystems selected such as the acidic Rio Tinto in Spain and the psychrophilic Antarctic Region. By developing innovative, accurate, and sustainable tailor-made sampling methods, employing cutting-edge bioprospecting techniques, and utilising state-of-the-art analytical tools for isolation of bioactive substances, in the EXPLORA project it is expected to find and isolate microorganisms which produce novel antimicrobial and antioxidants compounds, sialylated extracellular polymeric substances and, plastic-degrading acidophilic enzymes which applicability will be validated for pharmaceutical, cosmetic, nutraceutical, and for PET recycling purposes, respectively. Additionally, deeper understanding on the legal frameworks in the planned contexts such as the Nagoya Protocol and Antarctic Treaty Legal Requirements is also envisaged. By achieving these objectives, EXPLORA will contribute to the sustainable exploration of biodiversity hotspot regions, advancing the development of next-generation sampling methods, expanding bioprospecting from the screening for new chemicals into biological function, and contributing to the understanding of potential trade-offs inherent in the exploitation of ocean and other aquatic biodiversity.|10.3030/101181841|Cluster 6

In order to enable a widespread development of hydrogen aviation, it is essential for airport operators that a future regulatory framework is implemented for the handling of large quantities of hydrogen at airports and that there is a clear understanding of how hydrogen-powered aircraft will be integrated into airport operations and the required changes to current aircraft ground handling operations are known. In parallel to this, and for industrial partners, it is also necessary to  develop new ground-handling equipment for hydrogen aircraft, and more specifically liquid hydrogen refuelling equipment that will enable safe and efficient turn-around operations. GOLIAT will demonstrate liquid hydrogen aircraft ground operations at three different types of European airports using a small hydrogen operated aircraft allowing the necessary procedures to be developed. It will also, through two demonstrators, showcase several critical technologies needed for future certified high-performance liquid hydrogen refuelling. In parallel, GOLIAT will answer key questions that will lay the foundations for the standardisation and certification framework of future safe hydrogen operations. Indeed, a key output of the project will be the gap analysis of certification rules and requirements for ground operations and equipment. Finally, GOLIAT will also assess the sizing and economics of hydrogen value chains for airports, critical for the competitive development of hydrogen powered aviation.

Soil health is highly under pressure and the soil’s ability to perform essential ecosystem services should be improved to cope with pressures such as climate change and need such as a healthy living environment. Spatial planning and design are practices that, when enriched by soil care, can enhance the current status of soils and support societal challenges and needs, while avoiding unwanted trade-offs towards other areas, generations or functions. SPADES will therefor provide a comprehensive state of the art on both planning and design practices, as on soil instruments. To be able to make a transition in spatial planning and design towards healthy soils a fundamental understanding of the current mechanisms is key. SPADES will develop integrative instruments and improve the information basis and brokerage to bring the spatial planning and design field and soil sector together. This will contribute to the methodological basis. SPADES will work in 17 pilots in 10 member states, covering a broad range of land uses (urban, peri-urban and rural areas), time and spatial scales, and soil and planning challenges. This is done together with local practitioners and policy makers to develop fit-for-purpose soil-inclusive spatial strategies to support different goals such as land degradation neutrality and no net land take. The SPADES instruments will be presented in such a way (manual and navigator) so that they can be found by the right user, at the right phase of the planning and design process, and for the right purpose. SPADES supports soil literacy (by capacity building and communication, dissemination and exploitation activities) to a broad range of target groups to enable current practice to improve.

There are two glaring omissions, however. The first is a sensitive, high resolution next-generation facility operating at (sub-)millimeter wavelengths (0.35-10 mm), a crucial observing window for the study of a broad range of astrophysical objects, from our Solar System to the Milky Way, nearby galaxies, and the distant universe. The second is that currently planned facilities are not truly prepared to operate in a low carbon emissions future, meeting the needs of the research community and the aspirations of the EU for carbon-neutrality. This project, consolidating the plans for the 50-meter Atacama Large Aperture Submillimeter Telescope (AtLAST), directly addresses both needs, providing solutions that will inform other observatories along the way, especially our partners ESFRI landmark (ESO-ELT) and project (EST). Our ambition is to harness European knowhow and cooperate on a global scale to revolutionise our understanding of the (sub-)mm universe, while pushing observational astronomy towards a greener future. Strengthened by a H2020-funded design study and an engaged community of about 200 researchers worldwide, we have produced science cases, telescope conceptual designs, and plans for a sustainable, off-grid power system.

These transformations, further accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, have led to significant diversification, rendering rural regions complex and unequal—similar in many ways to major cities. Thus a key problem concerns our knowledge about- and perception of these places because the tools, concepts, and above all the public policies traditionally applied are no longer suited to address the increasing diversity of contemporary rural areas. Our consortium, RURALITIC, is academically armed and well-prepared and to tackle these challenges. The first step, involves rethinking ’the rural’ and examining the intricate relationship between social groups and geographical spaces. This conceptual requalification of what rural areas are, and can be, will enable the production of new scientific concepts and tools, including new data, surveys, indicators, knowledge and typologies, enabling a new and synthesized view of the current dynamics and processes of change and aid in foresight for public authorities.

The project will innovate on Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology, currently holding the c-Si power conversion efficiency record of 26.81% for single junction c-Si solar cells. By targeting higher efficiencies and lower costs, TERASUN paves the way for mass production of improved SHJ solar cells. TERASUN will develop: (i) nanophotonic structures on module cover glass to minimise reflection (maximise absorption) and improve anti-soiling properties and improving the overall performance of the module, which will allow for reduced silicon consumption and higher efficiencies; (ii) innovative texturisation, including micro- and nanostructures for optimal light-trapping to enable the use ultrathin crystalline Si solar cells; (iii) novel heterojunction contacts based on metal-oxide layers implemented in interdigitated back contact (IBC) SHJ solar cells for very high efficiencies, and low-cost surface passivation for advanced surface structures; (iv) low-cost metallisation, replacing silver with copper to move towards a technology ready for terawatt production scale; and (v) direct bandgap architectures for implementation in IBC SHJ solar cells. These developments will help with approaching the fundamental limit of 29.43% on cell level and reducing cell-to-module losses for optimised energy yield. The strategic choice of materials (Cu, Al-doped Zn oxide, Sn oxide) will reduce the costs and supply chain risks. Environmental, economic and performance data associated with the developments will be gathered, evaluated and used to develop an algorithm based on multi-disciplinary design optimisation to create the TERASUN decision support tool (DST). The DST will provide stakeholders from industry and policymakers with: (i) recommendations related to the most promising technologies and (ii) a clear roadmap for the technologies developed in TERASUN towards TRL9.|10.3030/101147545|Cluster 5

NAP4DIVE strives to revolutionize the traditionally expensive and inefficient drug development for these diseases by establishing advanced non-animal alternatives for testing and predicting nanoparticle (NP)-based drug delivery across the human BBB. This approach aligns with EU and global initiatives to reduce animal testing and advance human-based biomedical research models. The project will develop two complementary non-animal tools: a high-throughput BBB-on-Chip and an in silico model based on machine-learning (“NP Design Simulator”). A digital repository of optimized nanoparticle designs “NP Design Library” will be created to gather publicly available and newly obtained NP characterisation data, specialised for BBB delivery. The Design simulator screens thousands of NP designs to recommend the most promising ones, which will be tested in vitro on the microfluidic BBB-on-Chip with real-time measurement of barrier integrity. The accuracy and physiological relevance of both tools will be validated by the pharmaceutical partner through comparison with clinical and pre-clinical data. NAP4DIVE tools will reduce animal use in CNS drug development by up to 95% while saving 30 % of costs. By identifying nanoparticles for cross-BBB drug delivery and offering avenues for new effective treatment options, NAP4DIVE addresses one of the most pressing healthcare challenges of the century. A comprehensive HTA will demonstrate market readiness and cost-effectiveness of the tools, an ethical assessment will analyse harm reduction and engagement with regulators and policy makers will promote non-animal alternatives in preclinical testing on a larger scale.|10.3030/101155875|Cluster Health

Today EGNSS provides accurate navigation capability, without requiring any specific ground infrastructure, to civil aviation users.  Equally, EGNSS will be a key enabler to develop highly accurate eVTOL flight procedures in both, visual (VMC) and instrument (IMC) metereological conditions: - for busy airports where eVTOL and aircraft traffic need to be segregated to optimize the airport capacity: highly accurate flight procedures will allow fully independent operations between aircraft and eVTOL traffics on busy airport, without blocking runway slots reserved for transport aircraft, and vice versa; - for isolated vertiport, heliport, landing location where eVTOLs will need to be integrated based on current airspace structure, with highly efficient flight paths, minimizing the noise footprint and avoiding most populated areas through higher levels of flexibility. The implementation of these new eVTOL flight procedures has to take into account the expectations at environmental level, especially regarding the noise footprint reduction. Indeed, these new procedures might be implemented above urban areas and consequently the noise impact is a major aspect to consider, in particular towards public acceptance. In addition, flight efficiency in terms of power consumption should be prioritized to minimize any impact on flight endurance.  The current proposal includes the development of low noise flight criteria and capable EGNSS-Copernicus avionics towards the gradual integration of seamless, efficient,and accurate eVTOL operations at busy airports and other landing locations in all-weather|10.3030/101180121|Other

The objective of CARE is to transform a total of 100 households in five European countries (Finland, Norway, Sweden, Germany, and Estonia) to circular model households. To achieve its aim, CARE will further develop, test and validate two pilots related to two critical material flows: food and clothing. They both have high potential for circularity at the household level. The CARE pilots will be implemented in five regions - both urban and rural -  that are part of the Circular Cities and Regions Initiative (CCRI): Tampere, Asker, Gothenburg, Berlin, and Lääne-Harju. The pilots are based on the practice-theoretical approach, which goes beyond state-of-the-art by focusing on holistic, social and material aspects of everyday life instead of individualistic and awareness-raising interventions. The pilots will contain both customized, inclusive, and cost-free circular advisory services as well as food and clothing related interventions that target changes in consumption practices. Impact assessment is a key part of the project that includes improvement in material efficiency, living conditions, and sustainable wellbeing. The effectiveness of the pilots for reducing environmental impacts will be calculated using life cycle assessment, especially the Product Environmental Footprint method. CARE will make a strong contribution towards accelerating fair, inclusive and sustainable consumer-based transition to CE. This is achieved by involving consumer-citizens, non-governmental and civil society organizations, municipalities, researchers, and CCRI regions in a transdisciplinary approach, based on co-design and co-learning. Furthermore, CARE will ensure the replicability and multiplication of its results through easy-to-use communication and dissemination tools, in collaboration with CCRI and other European circular economy initiatives.|10.3030/101135141|Cluster 6

The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in an acceleration of a range of complex and multidimensional trends at the workplace. There is also increasing awareness of the importance of mental and physical health of workers and fundamental interconnections of work, health and well-being. Climate change is further shaping the future of work on an unprecedented scale. European economies are undergoing transformation and reorientation towards sustainability. The European Green Deal is reforming the workplace through implementation of new sustainable work practices and policies, circular economy solutions, and rapid expansion of work in green jobs, resulting in novel workplace exposures with likely impacts on health. Increases in complex algorithmic management and performance monitoring are also taking place with a view towards sustainability. There have been calls towards inclusive green economies ensuring social protection, and the creation of decent green jobs. The overall objective of the INTERCAMBIO project is to promote mental and physical health of workers in changing work environments due to climate change, implementation of new working practices, and among workers in green jobs. We will examine key research questions regarding mental and physical health of workers and conduct detailed evaluation of interventions in strategic industries in Europe relevant to green and digital transitions, including in outdoor construction, health care, public transit, renewable energy (wind turbine), and waste management/recycling using a variety of multidisciplinary and state-of-the-art research methods. We will leverage large, geographically diverse longitudinal cohort consortia for new climate-related studies, promote a framework for social protection, and engage multi-level stakeholders.

However, their slow growth rate in nature and the consequent difficulty to obtain large amounts of single compounds have until now severely hindered the in-depth exploration and exploitation of the full spectrum of activities of liverworts secondary metabolites. Recent breakthroughs in the identification of some of the genes involved in the early steps of liverwort-specific compounds suggest that, in addition to the establishment of improved methods for growth in axenic conditions, reconstruction of liverwort metabolic pathways in heterologous systems is a promising way forth towards the practical exploitation of liverwort biochemical diversity and its industrial scale up.The BRYOMOLECULES project will use a combination of cultivation of axenic cultures and production of the active compounds in heterologous systems to define the most suitable production platform(s) for their large-scale production. The project will achieve a very sustainable use of the chemical diversity of wild EU bryophyte species, a largely untapped source of high added-value natural products, without significant impacts on their biodiversity.Besides the identification of relevant lead compounds for cosmetics/cosmeceuticals and pharmaceutics , another  major impact of the project will be the production and release according to FAIR principles of a database of metabolites and biosynthetic genes of European bryophyte species that will fuel in the years to come the development of novel bio-based products based on bryophyte-derived lead compounds, according to the concept of EU valorizing biodiversity for EU bioeconomy.|10.3030/101135305|Cluster 6

AGRI4POL’s ambition is to assist the transition of agriculture from being a pressure on pollinators to becoming a positive force for managing and restoring pollinator biodiversity, crop pollination services, and co-benefits to ecosystems and people. To achieve this transition towards more pollinator friendly farming systems and value chains, AGRI4POL will advance scientific understanding of crop-farming system-pollinator relationships from the crop gene to the agroecosystem. By evaluating the genetic basis of crop floral traits attracting and rewarding crop pollinators, we will identify candidate crop lines suitable for breeding future pollinator-smart varieties. We will study how pollinator-crop relationships are modified in space and time, by the diversity and rotation of crop species and varieties, by ecological infrastructure (EI) comprising landscape features and non-crop habitats, and by future climate or land-use change. Synthesising this information from the gene to agroecosystem scale will allow us to provide integrated recommendations for optimising landscapes for crop pollination, pollinator biodiversity and multiple ecosystem benefits. AGRI4POL research will be framed and supported by early and sustained multi-actor engagement along agri-food chains to assure its relevance and the acceptability of management options to farmers and society. This multi-actor approach will also enable assessments of the socio-economic and policy obstacles and opportunities affecting the feasibility and uptake of pollinator-friendly farming at [sub]national, European and international scales. AGRI4POL will therefore showcase to farmers, agri-food actors, policymakers and society the importance of pollinator-friendly farming to food security and sustainability goals (EC Green Deal, Nature Restoration Law; UN SDGs).|10.3030/101181146|Cluster 6

The project's overarching goal is to establish FTTS as a center of excellence in multidisciplinary road safety research, education, and innovation. TWINSAFE aims to promote knowledge sharing, best practices, and a multidimensional approach, including joint research, capacity building, internationalization, diversity, and entrepreneurial thinking.Road safety is a global concern, with road accidents causing a substantial loss of life and severe injuries worldwide. The EU has set ambitious targets to reduce road fatalities and injuries by 50% by 2030, emphasizing the Safe System Approach. However, disparities exist among EU member states, including Croatia, where challenges persist despite high-quality road infrastructure. These challenges result from a lack of integration and interdisciplinary collaboration among stakeholders.TWINSAFE seeks to address these challenges by fostering cooperation with the newly established Centre of Excellence for Road Traffic Safety (CERTS). CERTS aims to unify experts from academia, industry, and the public sector, encouraging interdisciplinary collaboration to develop innovative solutions and align research with the Safe System Approach.In summary, the TWINSAFE project's mission is to elevate road safety research and innovation at FTTS, collaborate with leading European institutions, and embrace an interdisciplinary approach through CERTS. The ultimate objective is to make significant strides in addressing the critical issue of road safety and contribute to the EU's ambitious targets for a safer road environment.|10.3030/101159114|Other

We will work together to significantly develop upon current knowledge of how FIMI can be detected, categorised, analysed, shared, and countered. We will achieve this through a series of coordinated contributions to the DISARM Framework, the NATO-Hybrid COE Attribution Framework, STIX 2.1, OpenCTI, ABCDE, and the FIMI countermeasures toolbox. This approach acknowledges the importance of TTPs and common data handling standards to the ability to attribute FIMI actors, and further positions TTPs within the broader analytical processes that are necessary to developing countermeasures.In addition to establishing improved technical standards and operating procedures, we will generate research knowledge that can support better decision-making about FIMI countermeasures. For example, we will conduct research into the public impact of attribution, research methods for linguistic and visual analysis, develop the understanding of how cross-platform manipulation evades traditional analysis methods, as well as establishing a dataset of previous FIMI interventions.

This builds on the assumption that bringing them into the European family of liberal democracies will increase the resilience of the whole European community against external negative interference. Combining insights from a variety of academic fields, RE-ENGAGE will deliver innovative research and concrete advice on how the EU should adapt its foreign policy tools to the current context. Russia’s war against Ukraine has radically altered European security, not only causing extreme civilian suffering in Ukraine, but posing a direct threat to neighbouring countries fearful of the war spreading. Confronted by the direst security crisis in decades, EU policymakers are forced to fundamentally rethink their security policies. Europe has demonstrated unexpected unity and resolve, adopting a series of sanctions against Russia, and increasing national defence spending to better handle potential military threats. This has also led to a revival of EU enlargement process. While this will not improve EU resilience to military threats in the narrow sense, it may counter hybrid warfare, which is the more likely threat faced by the EU and most of its neighbours. The neighbourhood policy and the accession process require urgent adjustment to build strong, resilient neighbourhood states capable of countering external threats, particularly those posed by hybrid warfare. A systematic investigation of how this can be achieved in the current context without compromising the EU’s values and security is therefore needed. Since Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014, there have been increasing calls from the EU for a more context-sensitive approach to its neighbours. RE-ENGAGE will assist the EU in determining how best to achieve this goal through an in-depth study of six cases – three in the Western Balkans and three in the Eastern Neighbourhood.|10.3030/101132314|Cluster 2

However, current projections suggest that the EU’s 2030 biodiversity target will not be met; an alternative plan is required. PLAN-B takes an integrated, multidisciplinary and multi-actor approach to deliver better understanding and support reduction of light and noise pollution impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services.  Key outputs of PLAN-B include: a framework and supporting handbook for assessing light and noise pollution impacts to inform environmental decision-making; an open access database on light and noise impacts on terrestrial biodiversity; spatiotemporal models for evaluating noise and light impacts on terrestrial biodiversity and ecosystem services, including at the European scale; innovative solutions to prevent and mitigate light and noise pollution impacts; recommendations for enhancing legal and policy frameworks to reduce light and noise pollution impacts on terrestrial biodiversity; and sustainable Communities of Practice (CoPs), centred around key stakeholder groups, on the impacts of light and noise on terrestrial biodiversity. Working with European and international partners, including from Brazil, CoPs, key networks (e.g. Biodiversa+) and the Horizon Europe sister project on aquatic biodiversity and ecosystems, PLAN-B will maximise its global reach and research impact.

A new structure is needed as the current Knowledge and Innovation system in the European Research Area is insufficient to address the emerging challenges of nourishing the European food system in a healthy, sustainable and fair way. The aim of FoSSNet is twofold, on one hand to establish a permanent pan-European network for Food System Science and on the other hand to advance inter- and transdisciplinary Food System Science and education. This will contribute directly to the farm to fork objectives and FOOD2030 priorities. Developing the network and advancing Food Systems Science and education will be underpinned by an inclusive approach to ensure engagement of all relevant disciplines, researchers and non-academic actors in advancing Food System Science. In order to reach the vision and aim, FoSSNet will 1) develop a conceptual framework and a process for developing food system transformation pathways to create a common language and understanding among food system thinkers, 2) establish, mobilise and consolidate an inclusive inter- and transdisciplinary pan-European academic network for food systems science to bring European food systems scientists and the science institutions together, 3) enhance inclusivity of the Knowledge and Innovation system for a sustainability transformation of EU food systems by addressing sensitivities to power relations and inequities that pervade food systems and contested transformation processes, 4) co-produce research for sustainable food system transformation to remove existing barriers to interdisciplinarity in food system science, 5) build food systems capability through an academy and curricula to ensure the impact of future food system thinkers and 6) create scientific, economic and societal impact by ensuring sustainability of the network.|10.3030/101134861|Cluster 6

Innovations on transistor technologies, following Moore’s law, can in part compensate for this rise and improve sustainability by providing more energy-efficient electronics. However, the energy-efficiency of CMOS is limited by the Boltzmann physics, which sets a lower bound on the operating voltage, and thereby the power. To sustain miniaturization, and improved performance of electronics, new transistor technologies are needed that can overcome this limit.AttoSwitch will develop a novel cold-source transistor technology that uses the intrinsically cold carrier distribution of Dirac semimetals to overcome the Boltzmann limit. The main objective is to develop a scalable Dirac transistor technology based on large-area integration of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, e.g. graphene and CoSi, and the realization of high-performance device demonstrators at technologically relevant length scales. Key demonstrators are based on graphene integrated with MoS2 and WSe2 channels, as well as novel work on 3D Dirac semimetals. Our methodology includes development of device process modules and extensive material and device characterization. Systematic modeling using new simulation frameworks plays a key part to benchmark and provide a road map for the technology. Our ambitious performance targets include a subthreshold swing of 35 mV/decade and a switching energy of 4 attojoule.The project links to ongoing European efforts, such as the 2D-experimental pilot line, and the goals set by the European Chips Act. AttoSwitch will impact the semiconductor supply chain at the technology and materials levels, and provide ultra-energy-efficient transistors for logic and high-frequency analog integrated chip markets. Outreach to students, training of young researchers and building international cooperation will also support Europe’s competitiveness in semiconductors.|10.3030/101135571|Cluster 4

Addressing this gap, the project's aim is twofold: First, to reveal whether and how ongoing de-democratization processes affect patterns of protest culture and how these effects vary according to democracy (consolidated, new and developing); second, to trace whether and how affected patterns of protest culture influence the state of democracy in target countries, by focusing on representation as inclusion of citizen preferences in political agendas. Research findings will shed light on two dimensions of protest culture, particularly its internal capacity and its external constraints. This will be done via analyzing historical contexts of variations in protest cultures across different types of democracy, factors intersecting to trigger or shape pro-democratic/anti-democratic protests, political elite manipulation of legal and discursive frames to curtail public discontent, role of traditional and social media creating opportunities or obstacles for actors engaged in contentious politics, generational differences in perceptions of and participation patterns in protest culture, and finally, influence of protest culture itself on the state of democracy through representation as an outcome of civic participation. The interdisciplinary project relies on methodological pluralism and integrates: desk research and legal analysis, biographical narrative interviews and focus groups, quantitative and qualitative content analysis, critical discourse analysis and visual analysis, network analysis for mapping actor-discourse coalitions, and Q methodology.

To improve monitoring tools for hydrogen leakages, HYway will develop novel emission modelling and installation-level emission measurements. We will measure the hydrogen soil sink using flux chambers and instrumented drones, and we will use this knowledge to improve process-based models of the sink. The Global Warming Potential of hydrogen and its Effective Radiative Forcing will be quantified, including the component contributions from methane, ozone, stratospheric water vapour and aerosols. HYway will also quantify several environmental effects associated with hydrogen emissions such as stratospheric ozone depletion and air pollution. HYway will build on existing methods to create realistic future scenarios to fully explore the climate and environmental impacts of a hydrogen economy, including co-emissions and associated reductions in fossil fuel-related emissions. HYway includes a large advisory board of industry partners, several of them from established hydrogen collaborations. The advisory board will assist in estimating hydrogen leakage rates and in establishing realistic scenarios for a future hydrogen economy. By evaluating the potential climate and environmental impacts of a hydrogen economy, HYway will provide critical information to policymakers and stakeholders, allowing them to make informed decisions about the role of hydrogen in the transition to a low-carbon economy.|10.3030/101137582|Cluster 5

In particular, research at some of the large-scale facilities, such as particle accelerators, which are either hosted or used at European Level are very energy intensive. Power usage may reach 100 MW or more, with energy consumptions comparable to small towns. To make progress in science, these large-scale infrastructures are essential despite their energy consumption requirements. At the same time, our society is faced with the enormous challenge to transition into a carbon-neutral economy, and to minimize our footprint in terms of energy usage from non-renewable sources, and our output of substances which burden the environment. For this reason, research infrastructures need to develop and use energy efficient technologies. The way we operate our infrastructures needs to be re-evaluated. Intelligent solutions which reduce energy consumption need to be developed. Through intelligent algorithms the energy usage of our infrastructures needs to be adjusted to the available resources, such as renewable energy, and should help in providing an overall stable energy supply to society.The RF2.0 consortium vision is to design and operate accelerators in the way that they can run safe and stable anytime on 100% renewable energy supply, i.e., almost independently from the public power grid.To achieve this vision, comprehThis project’s originality lies in the comprehensive analysis of large research infrastructures’ energy management problem, from component to system level, both at experimental physics and energy engineering level, and in developing and testing in realistic environments of possible corrective actions.The RF2.0 project will involve 6 world renowned research infrastructures for the acceleration of particles, of which 5 of European Interest, an energy technology lab, and 4 SMEs focused on the (co-)development and technology transfer of new energy solutions.|10.3030/101131850|Other

The objective of the project is to demonstrate roll-to-roll (R2R) processed photovoltaic (PV) module with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of >20% at an area of >900 cm2, and thus overcome the efficiency gap between lab-scale and fab-scale processed devices, elevating the TRL up to 7. One of the unique selling points of this work is the commercial substrate foil based on aluminum with fluorinated-tin-oxide (FTO) electrode layer, which is an intellectual property of HyET Solar, the end user in the consortium. By using this substrate foil, LUMINOSITY will alleviate the bottlenecks related to limited process window of typical polymer substrate foils – such as high quality nickel oxide charge transport layer deposition (requires 300ºC thermal process) – to reach high stability, efficiency, and lower environmental impact, while keeping the flexibility. The consortium encompasses the full value chain from research and technology developers, equipment manufacturers, suppliers, and industrial end-users. Together, we are well-equipped to surmount the existing challenges that have hindered the widespread adoption of PSC technology. Specifically, LUMINOSITY will achieve operational stability exceeding 20 years that rivals the lifetime of current commercial thin film PV technologies, while ensuring economic (0.14 USD/W at R2R production scale) and environmental feasibility (50% lower CO2 foot-print in comparison to c-Si PV), substantiated by comprehensive Life Cycle and Techno-economic Analysis.LUMINOSITY will fast-track the market uptake of flexible perovskite PV technology and thus enable rapid increase of PV installation capacity in EU to reach the goals set by REPowerEU plan.|10.3030/101147653|Cluster 5

A vital prerequisite of the de-carbonisation is the rapid growth of renewables. In 2050 more than 60 % of electrical power is expected to come from wind and solar, both significantly more remote located than traditional thermal power generation. To achieve this, efficient grid-integration of renewables across Europe and globally requires the development of high-power transmission systems and components, and more specifically Medium Voltage DC (MVDC) and High Voltage DC (HVDC) switchgear. In existing grids MVAC and HVAC switchgear is filled with the insulation gas SF6, the world's most potent GHG with a global warming potential (GWP) of 24 300. SF6-emissions due to leakages during gas handling or defective sealings / compartments represents a significant part of the grid owners' total GHG emissions.  MISSION project will develop and demonstrate three SF6-free products as key-levers for climate neutral power transmission based on the requirements defined by TSOs, filling critical gaps in future hybrid ACDC grids: 1. SF6-free HVAC circuit breaker will be developed and type tested by Siemens Energy and installed and demonstrated by Statnett in Norway and RTE in France reaching TRL 8, 2.

EL will de-risk the CO2 transport and storage by eliminating the main uncertainties of T&S by industrial demonstration, in-depth studies and stakeholder engagement. By constructing and testing a km long transport pipeline fully integrated into the commercial operating CO2 storage, the key process parameters and technical aspects for a full-scale CCUS complex will be validated. The critical risks of the T&S part will be eliminated by an industrial demonstration and comprehensive set of studies leading to permitting.To minimize the risks, saline aquifers from North West Bulgaria will be used for safe and large capacity CO2 storage close to a major CO2 source and Bulgarian pipeline corridors. Extensive geological, geophysical and testing work will be done to address critical issues as induced seismicity and safe injection over time. By actually constructing a short pipeline, specific issues like land-owner allowances will be addressed and the transport will be made ready for permitting and execution for the entire corridor cross-border cluster connecting members to the CO2 sink.

Current treatments, based on cell-free grafts or cell-based therapies, are expensive and often with limited availability, ultimately leading to total arthroplasty to relieve the pain and restore function. However, the risk of revision of these implants is unacceptably high in young active patients, predicting a looming epidemic of revision surgeries as these implants start to fail. LUMINATE proposes a personalized, one-stage regenerative approach to target large osteochondral lesions, thus preventing PTOA and avoiding costly and invasive arthroplasty surgeries. LUMINATE will develop a next level in situ bioprinting unit, called EndoFLight, which combines three toolheads (i.e., micro-extrusion, filamented light, jetting) to print photoresins laden with patient-derived cells directly at the site of injury. EndoFLight uses filamented light to bioprint highly architected scaffolds with excellent cell guidance properties in seconds. Together with micro-extrusion and jetting toolheads in an arthroscopic set-up, we can deposit multiple biomaterials, biomolecules and cell types together with light-assisted crosslinking of complex structures directly in vivo in a minimally invasive manner. The whole procedure will be extensively validated in a human-relevant in vivo large animal model, paving the way for clinical translation after the end of the project. The exploitation of the results will be ensured through market analysis, the foundation of a spin-off that will commercialize the project results, and analysis of regulatory aspects of all components of the bioprinting suite. Overall, LUMINATE will ensure wide-spread health benefits to the patients suffering from these lesions and will pave the way for enormous socioeconomic advantages for our aging society.|10.3030/101191804|Cluster Health

Earth system models (ESMs) are essential tools for projecting climate change, providing important information to decision makers. However, confidence in predicted climate change is undermined by a number of uncertainties; (i) ESMs disagree on how much the Earth will warm for a given increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity); (ii) how much emitted CO2 will stay in the atmosphere to warm the planet (half the CO2 emitted by humans has been absorbed by the land and ocean) and (iii) how much excess heat in the Earth system will enter the ocean interior, delaying surface warming (~90 % of the heat in the Earth system goes into the ocean). Central to these uncertainties are poorly understood, and poorly modelled, Earth system feedbacks, in particular cloud feedbacks, carbon cycle feedbacks and ocean heat uptake. Poor representation of these phenomena degrades the accuracy of ESM projections, with implications for anticipating future climate extremes and societal impacts. We aim to improve the representation of these feedbacks in ESMs, reducing uncertainty in global warming projections. We propose a multidisciplinary approach, focused on “learning” how to accurately describe processes underpinning these feedbacks, through a fusion of observations with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Such data and approaches, constrained by the laws of physics, will deliver a step change in the accuracy of Earth system models. AI4PEX will place Europe at the forefront of a revolution in Earth system modelling, leading to increased accuracy of climate change projections and superior support for implementation of the Paris Climate Agreement and the European Green Deal.|10.3030/101137682|Cluster 5

The WeatherGenerator will be task-independent and will improve results for a wide range of machine learning applications when compared to task specific machine learning tools. It will also be more resilient for climate applications when the underlying data distributions are changing, and it will lead to a significant reduction in computational costs and faster turnaround times. To achieve this, we will: (1) Collect and use the most important datasets of Earth system science including data from Digital Twins of Destination Earth, selected observations, analysis and reanalysis datasets, and output of conventional Earth system models.

The Destination Earth (DestinE) initiative responds to this need by developing Digital Twins (DTs) of the Earth. In particular, DestinE Climate DT provides climate information at regional and local scales over multiple decades. However, the reliability of the impact assessments of Climate DT depends on the underlying km-scale climate models, which fail to represent some key components of the Earth system.We aim to enhance the DestinE infrastructure by developing a Digital Twin of the Earth system for the cryosphere, land surface and related interactions (TerraDT). TerraDT subscribes to the DestinE vision of building interoperable and interactive DTs, while pushing the resolution to km-scale, globally. TerraDT improves the descriptions of Earth system components in the DestinE climate models for land ice, sea ice, aerosols and land surface. TerraDT is based on a modular infrastructure with a coupling interface that enables adding new components or AI/ML-based emulators. TerraDT also develops impact models linked to the cryosphere and land surface to provide user-relevant information with interactive capabilities. TerraDT developments enable their full integration to the DestinE framework. Overall, TerraDT will improve the reliability and relevance of the climate projections and impact assessments of DestinE, which is critical for guiding adaptation and mitigation actions.The TerraDT consortium consists of 18 organisations with expertise in Earth system modeling, supercomputing and impact assessments. TerraDT will also engage with relevant users and stakeholders. The consortium includes the key partners from the DestinE Climate DT contract team.

As a first step, the high costs and shortsighted prospection are tackled with passive surface-based imaging methods and uncertainty encompassing modelling alternatives. In parallel to reducing measurement bias, our approach engages a larger population and stakeholder group in search for optimal locations for geothermal exploitation. In the following step, GeoHEAT illuminates the subsurface to an unprecedented extent through a novel georadar probe. The georadar imaging is complemented with drilling-induced microseismicity monitoring and digital rock physics models to create a high-resolution understanding of the reservoir. Our novel, multi-scale approach unlocks the potential of informed deviated drilling, optimal wellbore placement and accurate performance and risk analysis. Throughout the GeoHEAT journey we propose effective and inclusive tools for public engagement and two-way communication while we introduce advanced decision-making tools for policymakers based on probabilistic modelling and uncertainty quantification. To maximize its impact and expediate its success, GeoHEAT consists of a complementary consortium with European leaders in the scientific, industrial, and public domain. The interdisciplinarity of our team allows us to look at geothermal energy exploration from different angles (e.g., geophysics, engineering, seismology, social sciences and humanities) and ensure the technical, scientific, economic and social sustainability of our proposed exploration workflow.

However, the growth of geothermal energy lags behind EU targets. This is because geothermal energy projects have comparatively high technical and economic risks, which impacts public support negatively and holds back investment. Reliable exploration strategies that have inherently lower economic and technical risks and hence increase public support are key to drastically reducing these barriers.FindHeat develops a novel, conceptual model-based geothermal exploration workflow. A modular toolkit, the FindHeat platform, provides innovative software tools and geophysical exploration techniques at significantly lower costs than the state-of-the-art. The platform will be validated across eight geologically diverse geothermal plays to demonstrate its economic and technical benefits arising from faster turnaround times for exploration and appraisal of geothermal resources, making better use of legacy data and non-invasive geophysical techniques, and constraining uncertainties with respect to the size of the heat source and the range of possible heat production rates. The FindHeat exploration approach enables geologically-based resource assessments and will lead to a paradigm shift towards exploiting geothermal resources with inherently low technical and economic risks, thus improving exploration success and economic feasibility. Comprehensive social science research at the use cases will help to earn the public trust that the FindHeat approach will lead to a more efficient and sustainable exploitation of geothermal energy.FindHeat brings together extensive expertise and innovation from industry and academia, covering geology, geophysics, engineering, social science, economics, communication, and technical training.

A third of all the offshore capacity installed could be floating since this technology unlocks wind potential in deeper waters at greater distances offshore. Technological trends have advanced towards high-voltage direct current (HVDC) as a mature solution over long-distance transmission. Dynamic export cables float in the water and carry power from the moving platform to the grid. A key challenge is these cables need to accommodate combined electro-mechanical-thermal stresses. No HVDC dynamic export cables currently exist and industry views this as a critical bottleneck for floating offshore wind development. Therefore, this is a key enabling technology for secure grid integration of large-scale and long-distance floating offshore wind power plants.HVDC dynamic cables for floating offshore applications present unique challenges and risks from technical, environmental, operational, and economical perspectives. To address these complex inter-disciplinary issues, this project brings together a consortium from academic experts, manufacturers, users, and insurance advisors. The project will: (i) validate the insulation reliability of a new dynamic HVDC export cable, (ii) establish fundamental understanding of combined electro-mechanical-thermal aging mechanisms, facilitating the development of test protocols that qualify and verify the integrity of HVDC dynamic cables, (iii) identify routes for material sustainability for the cable to meet the EU’s circular economy ambitions, and (iv) use the underpinning technical knowledge gained to reduce risk and build confidence for deploying the new cable technology and thus enhancing the insurability and financial viability of future floating offshore infrastructure.

Low-cost nature-based solutions need to be identified, assessed and promoted on a large scale for both CO2 sequestration and biodiversity conservation. WILDCARD will, for the first time in Europe, assess the overall potential impact of natural rewilding of abandoned agricultural land and proforestation on carbon sequestration and biodiversity at multiple spatial and temporal scales. Combining field observations, remote sensing, and vegetation modelling with economic, societal and political analyses, WILDCARD will inform national and European policy makers on the contribution potential of nature-based solutions to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The project will investigate the regulatory, cultural and economic barriers to natural rewilding and proforestation, and identify which social innovation mechanisms, models and incentives can better support our CDR approach. WILDCARD will use a dedicated cross-scale analysis, linking site-based in-depth knowledge on rewilding impacts and socio-economic consequences to a European-scale assessment, embedded in the current EU policy context and informed by global scenarios from IAMs and ESMs. The final project’s aim is to offer concrete and realistic policy options aimed at enhanced uptake of rewilding as a significant solution to achieve global climate objectives.|10.3030/101081177|Cluster 5

The project aims to achieve nine objectives, including developing a traceability system for building materials, developing a holistic methodological framework for assessing circular use of construction products, and developing on-site and off-site smart digital solutions to identify construction entities and analyse their properties.The methodology of SUM4Re is based on a systemic approach that encompasses three main activities: identification, analysis, and contribution to circularity. The project aims to develop software tools and databases based on robust identification assisted by AI and other digital techniques, supported by blockchain solutions, and consider circular economy processes such as Reduce, Reuse, Repair, Recycle, and Renovate. SUM4Re will improve the BIM standard to support current circular (C-BIM) challenges, following open standards and ensuring interoperability with commercial databases.SUM4Re proposes three demonstration pilots linked to construction projects to validate the methodology and a strategy for skill development to upskill the workforce in the construction sector and facilitate the uptake of the solutions developed. Overall, SUM4Re aims to support the transition towards circular construction practices and reduce the amount of construction and demolition waste sent to landfills.The relevance of the project lies in the need to address the increasing generation of construction and demolition waste, which is the largest waste stream in the EU, as well as the problems associated with CO2 emissions and climate change. The project emphasizes the use of new techniques and technologies to rapidly identify materials and support circular construction practices.|10.3030/101129961|Cluster 4

The target portfolio of products will be fish oil, fish protein hydrolysates, bacteriocins, pigments, vitamins, collagen and calcium-rich powder, targeting food products, additives, supplements and nutraceuticals. The cascade conversion processes will vary with the feedstock heterogeneity, comprising pre-treatment, oil green extraction, proteolytic fermentation (protein hydrolysis), fermentation with hydrolysates as substrate, and a portfolio of downstream processes. The proteolytic fermentation will be guided by computational biology, using models to search new candidate enzyme-producing bacteria. The fish protein hydrolysates obtained in the fermentation will be used, first, as food supplement due to their bioactive properties, and second, as substrate for supporting a second fermentation, to obtain high-value bioproducts, namely bacteriocins and astaxanthin, as food additives, and vitamin B12, as food supplement. Novel genome-scale metabolic models will be used to link substrate composition to the desired bioproducts via inspection of metabolic pathways and selecting optimal microorganisms. In a zero-waste aim, the fermentation side-streams will be valorised (bones by extraction and calcination, and residual biomass by anaerobic digestion). All the bioproducts will be analysed for chemical, nutritional, bioactive and safety properties to comply with EU regulation, and will be included in food/nutraceutical formulations and validated by end users. A mathematical model will be developed to simulate the biorefinery and to support the satisfactory scale-up of the core processes as well as the assessment methodologies (technoeconomic, environmental, standardisation). Social impact and acceptance of the products will be also assessed.|10.3030/101135078|Cluster 6

Perioperative care depends on clinical decision-making, a continuous process that involves many healthcare professionals (incl. radiologists, surgeons, anaesthesiologists, nurses, and others) who – based on the best available evidence, clinical experience, and the patient's individual circumstances – make informed decisions on the best course of action. Even though advancements in medical imaging modalities (CT, MRI, ultrasound) have greatly improved surgical outcomes, their interpretation towards deciding a specific course of action remains subjective. In addition, these modalities have several limitations when used alone (e.g., missed lesions; cannot provide a 3D visualization of key structures such as vessels), ultimately failing to provide a full picture of the patient’s anatomy that is shared and unambiguously understood by all in the assigned team. Due to these limitations, there are often suboptimal decisions that add to a cumulative risk of surgical complications in perioperative care. HoloSurge is a joint undertaking that brings European scientists and clinicians from high-tech companies, clinical centres, and research institutions in a consortium to deploy an innovative AI-based medical system that: i) enables automatic fusion and segmentation of state-of-the-art  imaging modalities for interactive 3D holographic visualization of patients’ organs; ii) provides real-time surgical navigation; and iii) allows real-time cell-level cancer diagnostics. The solution will provide surgical teams with an unmatched holistic view of the patient’s anatomy and pathology in real-time at point of care, before and during surgery. This innovation will be validated for cancer interventions, while creating a trail of better-informed perioperative decision-making that can save countless lives.|10.3030/101137233|Cluster Health

Since the use of hydrogen does not generate CO2 emissions, hydrogen can be a solution for decarbonising these otherwise hard-to-abate industries. In-fact, hydrogen from renewable energy sources is expected to contribute to decarbonise a large part of the EU's metallurgical industry by 2050. However, since it is not as strong a reducing agent as carbon, there are several metals that cannot be produced directly with hydrogen. Some of these, such as silicon (Si) and manganese (Mn), are crucial for successfully building Europe’s clean technology value chains and meeting the EU’s 2050 climate neutrality goal. In fact, Si and Mn are both defined as Critical Raw Materials (CRMs) and Strategic Raw Materials (SRMs). The European Commission has proposed a regulation on that aims to strengthen the EU’s capacities and resilience along the CRM and SRM value chains. This cannot be done in a sustainable way unless production of CRMs and SRMs can be performed without CO2 emissions.The overall ambition of MECALO is to develop an innovative CO2-free production concept for CRMS where renewable hydrogen is used to eliminate the need for fossil carbon . Our goals are:-To target 95% reduction of CO2-emissions from Si and Mn production-To replace 9 million tonnes of annual coal imports by 15 billion Nm3 of H2 in 2050-To save 33 million tonnes of annual CO2 emissions in 2050Our concept will be applicable to all carbon reduction processes without any need for completely new, low TRL production technology.

UPBEAT will create novel UQ methods and tools to support the production of safer and more innovative aircraft structures and engines while reducing uncertainties in product and engineering lifecycles. The project focuses on metal-composite hybrid aerospace engine parts that are lighter, more durable and cheaper. Innovative design solutions for hybrid interfaces can be achieved using metal additive manufacturing (AM) bonded with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Advanced models of materials and processes will be developed using sophisticated in-situ and ex-situ monitoring and metrology. In aviation engines, the outlet guide vane (OGV) is an essential component that helps de-swirl the flow field from the fan. The OGV's stiffness is crucial as it influences the engine's performance and includes a major load path from its core to the wing. The OGV with two types of CFRP vanes and titanium end fittings will be used as a demonstrator. By combining AM with advanced in-situ melt pool monitoring and characterization (micro-CT & nanoindentation), digital models will be used to optimize design and manufacturing processes and increase awareness on efficiency, safety and risk. This will result in 20-40% weight reduction and 50-70% fewer defects. Streamlined product development reduces qualification time by 30-40% and costs by 25-35%. In-line quality assurance support lowers manufacturing costs by 30-50% and time by 20-30%. UPBEAT will: ✔ Increase understanding of the process, structure, property, & performance with safety focus ✔ Advance process models (AM, CFRP) for planning & optimization ✔ Develop verification and validation using multi-scale models ✔ Integrate UQ in design, materials, manufacturing, qualification, & certification ✔ Demonstration of UPBEAT technologies using a complex aviation use case|10.3030/101147799|Cluster 5

A key tool is electricity storage, especially providing high-capacity, long-term storage and transportability. However, currently-proposed energy-storage technologies are either based on energy-inefficient multistage processing or require electrified units at temperatures not compatible with catalytic steps. hyPPER vision is to combine process intensification and innovative molecular catalysis to bring out ground-breaking efficient, load-flexible and scalable reactor technology that intimately integrates LOHC-based storage and proton-ceramic steam-electrolysis/fuel-cell. hyPPER will develop a compact reactor cell integrating a hybrid layered membrane and selective electrodes. Through the first-principles engineering of a proton-conducting electrolyte heterojunction, both ionic transport and electrocatalysis at LOHC-cycle operation conditions (250-400°C) will be enhanced. As a result, this compact technology will boost atomic and round-trip efficiency in energy storage potentially reaching >75% , thus cutting associated GHG emissions. Integration of the hyPPER concept in existing and emerging RE-plants and use cases will contribute to expanding the business portfolio and strengthen the sustainability and economic base of the energy sector. Up-scale viability will be analysed by considering techno- economic, regulatory, societal and sustainability criteria. Upon fabrication of the cell applying advanced thin-film methods and catalyst integration, hyPPER will validate this technology (TRL-4) in the reversible electrochemically-driven LOHC charge/discharge.

To be economical and sustainable the recycling of PV waste needs to efficiently recover all of the material constituents at a quality suitable for the reuse in new PVs, with minimal impact.  APOLLO will create a circular approach to link legacy recycling, future production and future recycling. A pilot line will be demonstrated and used to process an input of 40 tonnes of PV waste which will be recycled, resulting in enough reclaimed materials for 1 tonne of remanufactured silicon and 30 exemplar PV modules. Incoming modules will be streamed by glass composition, enabling batch recovery of high-quality glass, to be used for new solar-grade glass. A novel continuous ‘sonification’ technique, (ultrasonically excited etchant) will rapidly separate silicon, silver, copper and other metals in a sequence along a pipe-based process. Used liquid etchants will be recycled in a closed loop resulting in low waste, small footprint. Further, recovered silicon will be refined to a purity suitable for new PV-grade ingot growth. The objective is to deliver purified silicon with a minimum purity of 99.9999%. Multiple innovations increase the percentage weight recovery from 18% to 93%. APOLLO will prove the suitability of the recycled silicon by growing new ingots, manufacturing solar cells and then new PV modules. 20 PERC-based modules, 10 Tandem modules and 30sqm of single junction perovskite cells will be made. These modules will incorporate new designs, materials and manufacturing methods, and be designed for disassembly and recycling. Blockchain-based Digital Product Passports (DPPs) for PV will be designed and implemented as well as an online marketplace for reused, remanufactured and/or recycled PV components.

This approach enables the direct transfer of hydrogen from biomass to LOHCs without the hydrogen gas production, while simultaneously generating high-value chemicals. By integrating chemical and energy sectors, the project aims to synthesize platform chemicals and achieve long-term energy storage in liquid form, enhancing both the sustainability and efficiency of energy systems.A major advantage of LOHC technology is its ability to transform hydrogen gas into a stable liquid energy carrier, significantly facilitating the storage, transport and distribution. To tackle the economic challenges associated with this technology, PeCATHS employs a cost-effective strategy that utilizes biomass as a hydrogen source and solar power as a renewable energy source. This method allows for the direct integration of hydrogen into LOHCs without the complexities of gas compression and storage, thereby reducing costs and enhancing competitiveness against conventional energy storage systems.PeCATHS addresses the critical need for sustainable and viable energy storage, transport, and distribution solutions through the use of advanced (photo)electrocatalytic transformations.

We will explore the training of deep neural networks on HPC systems with self-supervised learning to transform raw geo-information into embeddings with up to 1000-fold compression. The main innovations will enable i) decentralized applications through substantial reduction of “data gravity”, ii) the portability of geospatial analytics by significantly lowering computational demand, iii) minimizing data labeling by few-shot learning, and iv) the near-real-time similarity search at petabyte scale of Earth observation and weather/climate data archives. The objectives of Embed2Scale target i) the exploration of ground-breaking AI-compressors enabling data federation to proliferate a MLOps reference implementation for embeddings in data centers, ii) to demonstrate data federation on real-world use-cases for the Copernicus Programme, and iii) to enable the Earth observation community by open-sourcing and standardization.

However, deep inequalities in education remain both within and between countries in Europe. Inequalities in learning outcomes, access to education and final educational attainment in Europe have been worsening and it is important to understand how socio-economic status, gender, ethnic and migrant status are associated with inequalities over the life-course. For this a longitudinal approach is needed and project LEARN (Longitudinal Educational Achievements: Reducing iNequalities) will highlight short-, medium- and long-term patterns of inequalities with a view to supporting educational policymaking in being able to robustly address these inequalities with interventions which are evidence based. Using a case study approach in nine carefully selected countries which capture the diversity of Europe’s education systems, LEARN will map and collect existing data providing original analysis of a range of high-quality education focused longitudinal educational data sets across Europe. LEARN will identify interventions that compensate educational inequalities by providing a synthesis of existing work across Europe examining specific trends in educational inequalities and interventions intended to reduce them. LEARN will then go on to develop tools for policymakers related to the findings of longitudinal analysis which support them in the policy making process.

HURRICANE is a 15 partners multidisciplinary consortium aiming to overcome limitations that are still holding back these cutting-edge innovations from becoming a disaster management standard.HURRICANE will unlock the potential of UGV operation in hazardous environment, relying on enhanced vision capabilities and smart integration over a holistic, resilient and real-time situational awareness infrastructure that includes innovative UAV-UGV cooperation pathways (laser-based charging, UAV supporting UGV regarding route planning) and multi-technology communication infrastructure (5G, RF, optical wireless). Data-driven optimization models will provide recommendations through a user-friendly API to support FR’s tactics. Three complementary pilots will be implemented to demonstrate the benefits brought by HURRICANE solutions, in several challenging environments: peri-urban areas (Corsica), mountains (Alps) and wildfires (Andalusia). Last, but not least, EU-wide advanced training modules will be implemented to raise awareness among FR about these innovative technologies, integrating new operational procedures.  At the end of the project, HURRICANE will show improved hazard management efficiency (60% operation time reduction, 95% false positive readout reduction), with reduced FR exposure to harmful situations, strengthened EU robotics industry leadership (5M€ of revenues and 50 jobs). In 2028, training will be provided for 100 FRs across 15 EU countries, aiming to achieve a total of 10,000 trained FRs by the year 2035.|10.3030/101168017|Cluster 3

During recent years, EDUC established a truly trans-institutional EDUC community of students and academic staff. However, performance gaps between EDUC members from Widening and non-Widening countries persist, especially in R&I and adoption of ERA policies. In EDUC-WIDE, we will reinforce the Alliance via 4 main aims:1. Ensure that the principles of Open Science are becoming an integral part of the research process and infrastructure of EDUC Universities.2. Introduce responsible research assessment as standard practice in EDUC and reach out to policy makers to make institutional and national environments supportive for reformed research assessment.3. Prepare EDUC researchers for diverse career tracks outside of academia and promote the development and implementation of the Gender Equality Plans in Widening countries.4. Initiate and scale-up R&I collaboration of EDUC Universities and their ecosystems and contribute to tackling of major societal challenges: the Green and Digital Transition, EU Missions, and UN SDGs.To achieve aims 1-3, we will establish expert groups on the topics of Open Science, Research Assessment, and Career Diversity and engage them in strategy building, knowledge transfer, staff exchange, training and the introduction of advanced R&I practice across the EDUC Alliance.To achieve aim 4, we will extend our interactions with ecosystem and global partners and develop R&I funding component with two bottom-up programmes: (1) Seed Projects, small scale projects preparing grounds for long-term R&I collaboration and (2) Access to Research Infrastructures, mutual use of R&I facilities within EDUC.Thus, we will empower the EDUC to claim a central role in regional transitions to knowledge-driven economy and society. While embedded in regional ecosystems, EDUC-WIDE has a robust European dimension and will contribute to 15 out of the 20 Actions of the ERA Policy Agenda.|10.3030/101136533|Other

The two technology lines are complemented by transversal activities for the definition of technical and techno-economic boundary conditions, the demonstration of the use of H2 for ground operations (i.e. H2 powered tow vehicle, demonstrated at the Malpensa site) as well as environmental, safety and regulatory cross-cutting aspects. ALRIGH2T has the ambition of demonstrating, for the first time, LH2 refuelling in a scale compatible with airport operations, synergizing with the Clean Aviation research and development efforts at the aircraft level. The project is implemented by a consortium built on the competences of top European industrial players, positioned along entire hydrogen and aeronautic value chain, complemented by research and technology organisations and selected member of the Advisory Board, including the EASA. ALRIGH2T is expected to be a cornerstone in the path towards the deployment of LH2 as an aviation fuel, strengthening the European research and industry leadership and consolidating the role of green airports as hubs of the H2 economy|10.3030/101138105|Cluster 5

New propulsion systems, such as wind-assisted, will contribute to fuel-savings. Still, whatever the pathway for a sustainable transition towards net zero emissions by 2050, more energy-efficient operations remain a prerequisite. This applies to the ship sailing as well as the port call processes. Efficient and viable voyage and port call optimization requires much increased cooperation between parties and overcoming several important barriers such as; charter parties and contracts enabling just in time arrivals and more explicit risk/benefit sharing; improved transparency and reduce cyber-security risks; reliable and efficient voyage and port call information sharing among all parties. Any new voyage optimization tool must take all these constraints into consideration and ensure full transparency on the arrival times to be agreed between the parties before the optimized route is activated.The goal of DYNAPORT is to develop new optimization and coordination tools for ports and ships that both reduce the ship's fuel consumption and increases port efficiency with at least 10%. KPIs will be developed to quantify and measure these savings. The tools will be built on information sharing through internationally accepted protocol standards and communication systems. To improve port efficiency as well as port approach safety, the system will integrate the port VTS in arrival and departure planning and execution.This goal is fully aligned with the Strategic research and innovation agenda for the partnership on Zero-Emission Waterborne Transport, underlining the lack of standardized technologies and infrastructure enabling operational integration with ports as one key barrier to faster decarbonization of maritime transport, but also with the IMO Strategy on the reduction of GHG emissions from ships, and wider initiatives by the EC, such as the European Green Deal.|10.3030/101138478|Cluster 5

The project will develop the necessary knowledge and prepare for the possibilities that potentially will arise from the deployment of CCAM, and will aim to increase knowledge regarding the necessary skills required for CCAM deployment. CCAM-ERAS will take advantage of the possibilities arising from CCAM deployment, by envisioning a future whereby CCAM can contribute towards a more attractive and inclusive labour market by providing solutions to ensure that the relevant skills are available and are able to be up scaled across the entire CCAM value chain.  Mitigating the resulting effects of introduction of CCAM requires multi-sectoral knowledge and cooperation between what were previously separate sectors (transport, technology, education etc.) CCAM-ERAS will develop new approaches and solutions to anticipate and mitigate the impacts and rebound effects on potential job losses and job relocations due to the deployment of road based CCAM systems and services, as well as boost innovation capabilities through the availability and upscaling of CCAM-specific professional skills. Schemes and actions that can contribute to the specific labour market challenges will be developed, in relation to specific 'real world' use cases.  CCAM-ERAS will also identify innovations and key innovators relating to CCAM deployment, particularly those relevant to the employment, socio-economic and skills effects  Including various stakeholders in the project activities will be crucial in achieving credibility and support for the results of the project. The development of a roadmap to support the socio-economic transition to CCAM will contribute to the legacy of the project. CCAM-ERAS therefore offers a set of building blocks that pave the way for a smooth transition to CCAM deployment over the short, medium, and long term.|10.3030/101147129|Cluster 5
