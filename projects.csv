SAGELi’s new cathode active materials (CAM) contain no Co. They are based on inherently-safe Mn-rich oxides. Additional safety will be ensured by reducing CAMs’ active surface area and an innovative coating. SAGELi’s safer binders target better adhesion, lower swelling and better processability to prevent safety issues from cracking and inhomogeneities. SAGELi’s flame-retardant electrolytes target stability at high voltage. SAGELi’s Flash Thermal Test will predict safety from just a few grams of novel materials, eliminating the need for upscaling to determine safety. SAGELi’s State of Safety Early Prediction Tool will predict EUCAR level during battery operation and ageing. SAGELi’s pouch cells will be demonstrated at 25 mAh and 5 Ah scale, and all SAGELi materials and cells are fully scalable and recyclable via existing processes.The consortium gathers (i) 5 top public research organisations whose previous results have been used in commercial batteries (CEA, FZJ, CNRS, CID, CICe); (ii) 7 companies committed to bringing SAGELi to market in existing and future factories across the EU for sales to customers worldwide: Umicore for CAM, Arkema for binder and electrolyte, Ccell for cells, Power4Future for batteries, FINCANTIERI for electric ships and THALES for electric aircraft equipment; and (ii) EU electromobility association, AVERE.SAGELi’s raw material cost is 23% lower than NMC811. SAGELI’s market penetration in 2030 is expected to generate ~1.4 bn€ of revenues for SAGELi’s EU partners by 2030 and >20.2bn€ in 2035. Its materials are expected to be used in 40GWh of batteries produced in 2030, 600GWh produced in 2035, and 700 GWh produced in 2040, providing a cumulative 1.9Mt C02eq savings vs NMC811. Preliminary LCA also predicts reduced water use, other emissions and land-use vs NMC811.|10.3030/101147312|Cluster 5

Nevertheless, these groups are invariably excluded from pandemic preparedness and response research, as during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Our ambition is to develop a dedicated pregnancy-infant preparedness platform for adaptive trials, to improve pandemic preparedness for these underserved populations.The objectives of PIPELINE are to: 1) establish a multi-country adaptive trials platform that that can support novel diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for infections in pregnancy and infancy, able to pivot rapidly to emerging health threats; 2) create and sustain a responsive and “ever-warm” clinical trial network of sites with expertise in recruiting pregnant women and infants and adaptive trial designs; 3) undertake an adaptive platform trial on respiratory syncytial virus immunisation in pregnant women and infants, to test the platform’s capabilities and address a public health priority for the EU; 4) evaluate novel sampling techniques and immunity approaches with relevance for preparedness; and 5) embed all activities within sustained dissemination, exploitation and communication with key stakeholders to translate results into policy recommendations.We will achieve these objectives through our multidisciplinary partnership with track records in maternal and infant health research, who will leverage and strengthen existing networks to maximise Europe-wide outreach to benefit PIPELINE. Our objectives are aligned with Horizon Europe Work Programme 2023-24 Health Destination 3 “Tackling diseases and reducing disease burden” as our work will reduce the health burden of disease through more effective management, lead to improved preparedness of health systems to respond to health emergencies, and reduce citizens’ risk of, and increase their knowledge about, health threats of epidemics.|10.3030/101155852|Cluster Health

Earlier diagnosis means earlier access to preventive interventions, which are now more effective thanks to next-generation immunotherapies. The clinical use of these new drugs is not consensual though, because of the severe side-effects they inflict in some patients. FluiDx-AD tests offer a pioneering tool to stratify and monitor patients eligible for these drugs, towards reducing their associated risk and accelerating their regulatory clearance in the EU.FluiDx-AD tests are thus devised to work complementarily and sequentially, covering the full AD diagnostic journey (from population-wide screenings to confirmatory diagnosis, and downstream patient stratification and monitoring), tackling key challenges of early AD diagnosis and AD prevention with new drugs, while also paving the way for the development of new therapies by streamlining patient selection and appraisal in clinical trials.FluiDx-AD brings together a team of highly motivated, committed, and reputed entrepreneurs, clinicians, and scientists from biotechs, hospitals, academic centres, and patient organizations across the EU. Leveraging our unique blend of trans-disciplinary/-sectoral expertise and access to advanced technologies and infrastructures, we join forces to realize the vision of a new era of AD clinical management for the benefit of millions of patients globally.|10.3030/101155955|Cluster Health

Despite aggressive therapy, about a third of patients have to give up work within 5 years of disease onset mainly due to lack of response to multiple disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), multi-drug resistance (MDR). Thus, the main objective of this proposal is to define the clinical and molecular phenotypes leading to MDR in RA patients to prevent when possible or, when not possible, optimise the management of these patients. MDR-RA is highly relevant to the program, as these patients are often disabled, unable to work and paying a high personal and societal burden. Moreover, MDR-RA is under-researched and the underlying pathobiological mechanisms for resistance remain unknown, while as we have no predictors of therapeutic response to any of currently available drugs, inevitably treatment is based on trial-and-error. MDR-RA has the ambition of transforming care for these patients and deliver significant advances beyond the state-of-the-art methodologies, as for the first time, molecular pathology will be integrated into clinical, psychosocial, pain perception and imaging profiling in existing clinical cohorts to develop truly holistic predictive models for future clinical use (iCare-RA). The transformative potential of iCare-RA will be tested in a prospective randomised trial in comparison with routine standard of care, while its future implementation potential will be assessed through an early economic modelling. Finally, a strong management and dissemination strategy will facilitate further advancing science in the field, beyond the duration of the project, and future adoption by patients, specialist professional bodies, policy makers and regulatory authorities.|10.3030/101155807|Cluster Health

ROSAS  aims at exploiting Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML), coupled with recent advances in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) technology and the underlying turbulence modelling to reduce expensive and time-consuming physical testing and drastically accelerate the whole design optimization process.Partners will build a methodology based on defining test cases, targeting the key flow problems encountered in industrial applications and reproducing them precisely in a controlled environment via Hi-Fi simulations or experiments. The results will be gathered in a database which will serve the development and testing of novel data-driven methodologies (AI-ML) and mesh generation algorithms. Improved turbulence models, including multi-fidelity surrogate models with advanced verification and validation process, will be created with modifications based on new theoretical considerations and AI-ML-based modifications, resulting in hybridization of specific turbulence models. In addition, Application Challenge test cases will be defined in relation to Clean Aviation applications to match closely industrial configurations of interest, to assess and demonstrate the new methodologies developed in the project.ROSAS brings together 14 partners from 8 EU countries and 1 from UK. The consortium comprises 4 leading research organizations, 5 leading university groups, a Super-Computing Centre, and 3 major aeronautical industries.

This is perhaps unsurprising, as many tissues and organs continue to mature postnatally, often taking many years to attain the compositional and structural complexity that is integral to their function. A potential solution to this challenge is to engineer tissues that are more representative of an earlier stage of development, using bioprinting to not only generate such constructs, but to also provide them with guiding structures and biochemical cues that supports their maturation into fully functional tissues or organs within damaged or diseased in vivo environments. It has recently been demonstrated that such developmental processes are better recapitulated in ‘microtissues’ or ‘organoids formed from self-organizing (multi)cellular aggregates, motivating their use as biological building blocks for the engineering of larger scale tissues and organ. The main goal of micro2MACRO (m2M) is to develop a new bioprinting platform capable of spatially patterning numerous cellular aggregates or microtissues into scaled-up, personalised durable load-bearing grafts and guiding their (re)modelling into fully functional tissues in vivo within damaged or diseased environments. This will be achieved using a converged bioprinting approach capable of rapidly depositing cells and microtissues into guiding scaffold structures with high spatial resolution in a rapid, reliable, reproducible and quantifiable manner. These guiding structures will then function to direction the fusion and remodelling of cellular aggregates and microtissues into structurally organised tissues in vitro and in vivo, as well as providing medium-term (3-5 years) mechanical support to the regenerating tissue.|10.3030/101191729|Cluster Health

So far, wide-scale applicability of TE devices was limited by their low conversion efficiency, typically 5% at system level at the most. STARTREC will develop and evaluate a new generation of TEG based on the optimal combination of nanostructured Si85Ge15 thermoelectric materials with innovative device architectures designed by simulation:1) Three different materials processing routes using nanostructuration to increase material performances: Additive Manufacturing (AM); Nanostructured Rapid Casting (Nano-RC); Optimized Rapid Casting (O-RC); 2) Innovative device architectures, such as complex forms and cascade architectures, which can considerably improve both their performance and their optimal temperature ranges, and so increase their efficiencies and potential for wider applications.STARTREC aims at doubling TEG efficiencies up to 10% at system level (15% at device level). It will demonstrate their high-performances in relevant environments at TRL5 for three different and complementary high impact use cases (industrial, domestic and space). Technical work will be completed by dedicated life cycle studies to address economic and environmental issues for these TEGs. A strong dissemination and exploitation strategy and novel circular business models will allow the developed solution to open new application opportunities in other sectors. With TEGs produced and commercialized by European industrial leaders, reinforcing EU strategic autonomy in renewable energy technologies, STARTREC has a complete value-chain with two RTOs, two universities, one technological SME and three industrial end-users.STARTREC will serve a global TEG market valued at 447.1 million € in 2020 and forecasted to reach 1365.8 million € by 2030.|10.3030/101160663|Cluster 5

DEFENDER’s revolutionary Research and Innovation pipeline will focus on preventing virus entry through a host-directed bottom-up approach based on functional genetics in parallel to a top-down virus glycoprotein-centered approach. We will identify novel host dependency and restriction factors, including receptors and proteins involved in viral attachment and binding, endosomal uptake and virus genome uncoating, as targets for antiviral therapy. In parallel, we will use recombinant viral glycoproteins to identify broadly neutralizing nanobodies and novel epitopes for the AI-based design of next generation immunogens and the improvement of therapeutic antibodies. The host bottom-up functional genetic approach will be applied to Nipah, Lassa, Zika, Dengue, Yellow fever, and Chikungunya viruses. Host factors will be identified using a unique arrayed CRISPR perturbation platform, combined with advanced statistical and machine learning approaches and mathematical modelling, mechanistic experiments, and cutting-edge imaging techniques. In parallel, the virus top-down glycoprotein-centered approach will lead to the identification and structural characterization of broadly neutralizing nanobodies targeting conserved epitopes of the glycoproteins of Nipah and Lassa viruses in pre-fusion conformation.

At the moment, most EO based crop monitoring tools are based on optical satellite inputs. In areas with substantial cloud cover the use of these applications is extremely limited. To be able to introduce more sustainable crop management practices, reliable and continuous time series on crop phenology and health throughout the growing season are needed. This will support farmers to match agricultural inputs (fertilisers, pesticides, water) with what the crop actually needs, decreasing their environmental footprint. DINOSAR will  do this by integrating the diagnostic power of optical, infrared and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) signals. With the DINOSAR project we intend to kickstart a revolution in EO-based solutions that tackle challenges in agriculture (under clouds) by making full use of the Copernicus infrastructure. We intend to take the existing methodology a step further by designing a multi-sensor operational monitoring method for a single crop (sugarcane) capable of operating on large data volumes, and then extrapolating this approach to practical field cases and to other crops (and geographies) for which the application of EO-based applications has been underexplored. Rather than looking at optical and SAR based data as two parallel signals, we will focus on integrating the two early on in the processing chain. This has not been done before. Sugarcane in Colombia is our initial test-case, but we will not stop there. DINOSAR will also develop a methodology integrating the combined observations from optical, infrared and SAR EO satellites to monitor other crops in other geographies.|10.3030/101129646|Other

Coastal “Blue carbon” ecosystems, such as mangroves, seagrasses, and salt marshes, play a crucial role in carbon sequestration and storage, biodiversity and coastal protection. Despite their socio-economic and biological importance, they face numerous threats from human activities and climate change, necessitating their conservation and management. Mapping, modelling and monitoring coastal zones using Earth Observation (EO) data is essential for this task. It needs to consider the complex coastal dynamics, past and future change scenarios, and the interaction between Blue Carbon and the coastal zone dynamics. By integrating EO data, advanced modelling techniques, and detailed process-based morphodynamic models, COASTS aims to develop a downstream service for coastal observation, with a focus on Blue Carbon. This service, utilizing Copernicus Marine and other initiatives, will provide govern. stakeholders and coastal planning with relevant information for developing coastal management strategies, including the assessment of blue carbon habitats and their environmental services. Further, COASTS will develop innovative methods and comprehensive analyses to create new business models related to emergent blue carbon markets and will offer new international income sources for countries with blue carbon ecosystem presence. COASTS will initially focus on pilot sites in Germany, Jersey, and the Maldives where govern. customers have a demand and support the project. The learnings from these examples will form a blueprint for broader application in other regions in response to a growing global need. Supported by an interdisciplinary team and strong links with governmental institutions, the COASTS project presents an innovative, scaleable and sustainable approach to coastal conservation and blue carbon management.|10.3030/101180091|Other

The project proposes the integration of Optical Camera Communications (OCC) into the intra-satellite environment providing the flexibility of this technology for enabling new unprecedented flexible design opportunities thanks to the inherent spatial multiplexing capabilities of OCC, its cost efficiency, and the possibility of grasping reflections on the inner walls (and objects) of the satellite to establish NLOS links.OCC4SAT addresses Area 2 of the call. The project will provide two main technology demonstrators (which will be discussed in more detail in the Implementation section): (i) an intra-satellite OCC network simulator that could serve as a tool for speeding up satellite design while providing performance estimates and (ii) a physical demonstrator based on a satellite mock-up able to showcase the flexibility, robustness, and performance provided by the OCC technology.The project's main objectives are a link range of around 1 m suitable for the mini satellites, a data rate above 3 kbps enough for the satellite operation, or a mass below 300 g using lightweight COTS cameras and discrete LED devices, to name a few. OCC4SAT will address several relevant challenges related to both the space and communications fields, such as the limited power supply, weight, space, and clearances in smallsats, or the high spatial multiplexation order of the OCC nodes, the increase of the data rate and the developed of links based on reflections on the payload surfaces, among other.|10.3030/101135434|Cluster 4

SEACLIM will leverage on regional ocean models of the Copernicus Marine Service to enable for the first time the pre-operational prediction of decadal and multi-decadal changes of the marine environment (ocean circulation, waves, sea-ice, biogeochemistry) through coordinated downscaling of the latest global climate models reference simulations (CMIP6). SEACLIM will also advance the understanding of physical and ecosystem processes to further develop regional ocean models. New regional ocean indicators will be developed to assess the ocean state and health over coming decades. SEACLIM R&I will be performed over three European seas: the northeastern Atlantic, northwest shelf including the North Sea and the Arctic Ocean, but will be replicable to other regional seas. SEACLIM regional ocean predictions, projections and ocean climate indicators will be integrated in the European Digital Twin of the Ocean, providing it with climate ‘what-if scenarios’.  SEACLIM new datasets will be benchmarked in coastal and ocean climate services for targeted policy and decision makers to support climate mitigation and adaptation actions and the blue economy. SEACLIM will co-design its R&I and exchange knowledge with key stakeholders and will bridge the gap between the operational oceanography and climate science research communities, ocean modelling and programmatic frameworks (e.g., Copernicus, WCRP CMIP, CORDEX, CLIVAR, RiFS, WMO, GOOS).

The growing use of commercial components (COTS), notably for the expanding market sector of constellations, means that European Space Industry is already using large amount of components with lead-free finishes even when the equivalent leaded high-reliable version is available. Even though the Space Sector is exempted from RoHS restrictions (Restriction on the use of certain Hazardous Substances), market pressure may also result on potential future difficult availability of leaded solder paste. This project addresses the main challenges of the Pb-free transition for the European Space Sector that were described in the Roadmap delivered in 2020 by the ESCC Task Force created to that end. First, we will study the obstacles that hinder today the wider use of COTS components in space projects using existing qualified assembly processes based on leaded solders. Second, we will launch a comprehensive evaluation of two lead-free solders that show promise for the Space Sector including reliability model development. Sn-solders were alloyed with lead at the beginning of the electronics era mainly to inhibit the growth of whiskers, therefore going to lead-free electronics creates a serious risk for space projects that may result in catastrophic failure in the satellite due to whiskers growth. The Space sector has developed mitigation approaches but the real challenge is to obtain accelerated tests that will give confidence that, for a given mitigation used and for the duration of the project, the risk is managed and acceptable. For that we propose to perform basic research to advance the state-of-the-art on our knowledge of whisker growth, leading to the determination of the pertinent activation energies that can be used in the design of accelerated tests. |10.3030/101135428|Cluster 4

The deployment of HVDC systems plays a crucial role in enabling electricity transmission over long distances with minimal losses. There is the need to bring new cable technologies that can increase the life cycle of future HVDC systems, and longer reach, more precise, easy to install sensor-based technologies to analyse cable status and locate potential faults.EasyDC-FOS project will commit to demonstrating a new generation of HV cable systems with optimised energy transport capability and longer life period, due to the use of an alternative XLPE insulation material, paired with the development of a series of smart tools for monitoring ageing and efficient fault detection in transmission networks, and reaching a TRL5 by the involvement of 3 demonstrators, 1 test bench and 2 real-world use cases, in different EU countries. This will be achieved by the: 1) optimisation of insulation materials for HVDC cables with operating temperature over 90ºC; 2) development of predictive models of physics and ageing behaviour of new cable system in response to thermal, acoustic and electric field stress stimulus; 3) prototyping of a set of fibre-based DTS, DAS, point vibration, and PD monitoring systems for long-distance cable corridors; and 4) integration into a cybersecure Edge Infrastructure that will allow real-time monitoring of cable conditions, as well as immediate response from TSOs, satisfying the KPIs in terms of system efficiency and stability, lifetime and thermal capacity assessment, and the accuracy of the sensors.For that purpose, EasyDC-FOS is bringing together a wide experienced consortium led by LMK, involving leading industrial technology developers of cables systems, a cable OEM, academic institutions, two TSOs, a key sector association, and sustainability and management experts at European level.|10.3030/101172806|Cluster 5

However, there are persistent problems with the recycling of such materials. The TOSCA project thus aims at the development of a processing chain for new epoxy vitrimer resins, which have the mechanical performance of conventional thermoset resins, but allow the more efficient recycling. This type of resin is already taking the first steps towards certification and there is a need to develop the related production processes.The TOSCA project will investigate a whole processing chain, including lay-up by automated fibre placement, curing, re-work, maintenance and repair. This processing chain will be supported by digital tools to acquire data through integrated inspection systems and through sensors for structural health monitoring, that are embedded in critical areas of the part. All these data will be used to iteratively improve production, aiming at a zero-defect manufacturing process.The consortium consists of research partners and industry covering all the processing steps. All of the research organisations are linked to industrial partners to ensure a proper take-up of the results by industry after the end of the project. About 2000 companies including OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers in Europe in the field of composite parts manufacturing (mainly structural parts) as well as machine building companies will benefit from the results.

An import question is how these potential new fuels will influence the emission of air toxicants and other environment- and climate-active compounds. LowC will address if these new fuels for high-power engines have an impact on the emissions of air pollutants and climate-drivers, considering also upstream emissions and secondary pollutants formed under different atmospheric conditions (daytime photochemical aging or night-time atmospheric radical chemistry). LowC will apply a series of state-of-the-art technologies and models. This includes a unique Engine Emission Facility equipped for testing of all currently considered low- or zero-carbon fuels with real ship, aircraft and land-based heavy-duty engines, oxidation flow reactors for atmospheric simulation, novel real-time in-situ exhaust characterization approaches, cutting-edge technologies for offline analysis of collected samples and advanced online air-liquid-interface (ALI) exposure systems for in vitro testing of biological effects in lung tissue models. The toxicological testing will be applied in a tiered manner (screening and in-depth verification), in line with visions of Toxicity Testing in the 21st Century. Emission data, including regulated and emerging pollutants, will feed into pollution emission and atmospheric transport models currently used to underpin EU policy and the Zero Pollution Action Plan.

Likewise, the large rate of fossil fuels/reductants needed in the current valorisation processes of these wastes make them very intensive in terms of CO2 emissions, requiring the metallurgical industry to move to H2 applications in its targeted pathway towards zero wastes goal. To tackle with these complex challenges and to solve the recycling of key steelmaking by-products like EAF dust, BOF dust and sludges, DR sludge and pellet fines and mill scales (among others), ZHYRON will develop an innovative valorisation route for Fe-rich and Zn-containing by-products based on the combination of pyrometallurgical (using green H2 as reductant) and hydrometallurgical stages The iron oxides units would be recovered as Direct Reduced Iron able to be consumed in EAF and the zinc would be recovered as zinc oxide concentrate to be used in zinc smelting sector, contributing thus to circular economy and industrial symbiosis approaches.The proposed technologies will be developed and endorsed at lab pilot scale (TRL6), and the obtained circular products will be validated by testing and characterization analysis. ZHYRON will also examine solutions regarding technical integration, economic and environmental criteria, contributing to the development of novel business models, guidelines and strategies.

New AI technologies are sites of negotiation and contestation. Different groups, based on their social positions, develop diverse and possibly conflicting ideas on what constitutes “success”. Expanding visions that define AI strictly in terms of technological and economic efficiency, FORSEE aims to develop a nuanced and enriched notion of success that will guide future AI applications and policy efforts. To achieve this, FORSEE draws from the social construction of technology to engage with three categories of stakeholders: a) institutional actors, b) “lifeworld” stakeholders (Civil Society Organizations representing gendered perspectives and Digital SMEs) and, c) the broader public. Then, FORSEE inquires into the impact of AI applications on economy, society and sustainability as well as on their alignment with EU values and strategic priorities. These interconnected research projects will illuminate a broader understanding of success that rests upon conflict resolution, empowerment of stakeholders, and alignment with fundamental rights and the goal of sustainable development. Based on these research findings, FORSEE will (i) develop a novel approach to AI governance that can guarantee more successful AI applications for society as a whole, including (ii) a new evaluative framework for assessing current and future AI applications, and (iii) a new prototype for registering risk and negative impacts. Through these outputs, FORSEE highlights and analyses existing successful AI applications to strategically enhance capabilities of our stakeholders and policymakers to address future risks and opportunities. Updating the SME sector’s understanding of success is a particular condition for the EU to retain a leading position in the AI landscape.|10.3030/101177579|Cluster 2

Europe is currently facing different scenarios with front and point introductions, affected wild boar and domestic pig populations, epidemic and endemic situations. While our traditional prevention and control strategies work well with industrial pig farms, we quickly reach our limits when we have to control the disease in the abundant wild boar population or in regions with a majority of backyard farms. To turn the tide and to safeguard animal health, vaccines, especially oral vaccines for wild boar, could be the missing tool.There has been considerable progress in vaccine development and while we should continue to look for alternative approaches, we must now also dare to test the promising candidates beyond simple proof-of-concept studies. Only in this way can we generate the data base for benefit-risk analysis of whether and how current generation vaccines could be employed.Along these lines, this project sets out to test the vaccine candidate """"ASFV-G-ΔI177L"""" in safety and efficacy tests after oral and intramuscular application as prescribed by international guidelines. This vaccine candidate has shown safety and very good protection under laboratory conditions and has been applied in the field in Vietnam. As a backup option, other promising candidates, “ASFV-G-ΔMGF” and “ASFV-G-Δ9GL/UK, will be tested in initial comparative trials. Accompanying the prescribed tests, our interdisciplinary consortium will characterize the protective immune responses, target the optimization of oral immunization and model tailored vaccination strategies. The data body generated in this project is crucial for benefit-risk-assessments at the level of all authorities entrusted with licensure and deployment of ASF vaccines and for this reason, relevant stakeholders will be involved from the start to guarantee full exploitation of our data."""|10.3030/101136676|Cluster 6

Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) has appeared for decades as a credible alternative but its poor energy efficiency, the need of fossil fuels and the use of existing underground cavities as storage reservoirs have limited its development. Variations to CAES have shown low efficiency, losing a big percentage of energy as heat and mechanical losses. Since the 2010s, there is a strong revival of scientific and industrial interest on CAES, led by China and the European Union (EU). For the EU, leading the new generation of high-efficient, low climate-impact and long-term energy storage research, is key to increase its energy independency.In this context, the main objective of Air4NRG is the development of an innovative, efficient (over 70% RTE), long-term, and sustainable CAES prototype, which can enhance renewable energy availability and offers robustness and safety while increasing cost effectiveness and improving the environmental footprint. At the same time, it will promote innovation and competitiveness in the European energy storage industry, while prioritizing the principles of circular economy and environmental sustainability. Another key factor of the solution is the integrability to the electrical grid system and their intelligent EMS, which will be proven by the end of the project through end user integration activities (TRL5). The project will result in a plug and play prototype, fitting into a standard 40ft container with an over ten-hours storage duration.

Since agriculture is by far the largest consumer of freshwater, sustainable production practices are the only way forward to mitigate the most severe impacts on the local environment, which is also acknowledged by the Australian agricultural sector. Scalable and transparent methods to report on the water productivity and sustainability are needed to allow agriculture industries to continuously improve their productive and sustainable water use. However, local reporting initiatives using in-situ data are labour-intensive, costly, and not scalable. Therefore, we aim to inform the Australian agricultural sector on the advances in EO-based water productivity and sustainability reporting. We will accomplish this by integrating state-of-the-art EO-based estimates on irrigation and precipitation and alternatives to locally sourced inputs with advanced hydrological models. Contrasting to most existing EO-based water productivity and sustainability indicators, we aim to include most of the intricacies of irrigation systems and the consequent losses that occur during the application of irrigation, enhancing the reliability of the indicators.

State-of-the-art technologies for solar fuel production (including natural photosynthesis) suffer from low solar-to-fuel conversion efficiency, low production rates and prohibitively high costs. Within the framework of SUN-PERFORM, we will address these critical limitations through an innovative biohybrid approach based on innovations in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. SUN-PERFORM aims to: 1) to develop artificial nanocrystal light-harvesting systems, to efficiently harvest a larger part of the solar light spectrum, 2) to generate advanced microalgal solar cell factories, by introducing synthetic pathways for a more efficient, rapid conversion of light energy and CO2 into lipid fuel precursors. Microalgal lipids are promising hydrocarbons for fuels, being already approved production pathways for Sustainable Aviation Fuel. However, current lipid production is still too inefficient and slow, hindering the cost-effective generation of renewable fuels. Through the implementation and integration of groundbreaking innovations at a pilot scale, SUN-PERFORM aims to achieve a remarkable four-fold increase in the existing solar-to-fuel efficiency. This will be demonstrated across two case studies reflecting the different solar irradiances received in Europe and Africa. In addition to technical advancements, SUN-PERFORM will comprehensively evaluate the sustainability, techno-economic and social aspects of this novel route, to guide its development as a truly sustainable, secure and affordable production platform. Diverse stakeholders, including industry and several partners in Africa, will be involved in SUN-PERFORM to support the global development and the European leadership and export position for solar fuel technology.|10.3030/101172946|Cluster 5

The iron and steel industry is responsible for high greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO2), constituting 5.7% of the total emissions in the EU (2.2 tonnes CO2 per tonne of crude steel cast, refer to World Steel data). Several European steel producers (including ArcelorMittal) have committed to fulfilling the goals outlined in the Paris Agreement and aligning with the European Union's target of achieving zero emissions by 2050, as part of the Green Deal initiative. These engagements entail a shift from the predominant method of steel production, currently reliant on blast furnace/basic oxygen furnace (BF/BOF) technology, to cleaner production techniques characterized by significantly lower CO2 emissions. As the industry shifts toward cleaner production methods, particularly those utilizing electric-arc furnaces (EAF) and emphasizing the recycling of iron scrap, concerns arise about the potential contamination of steel with residual elements like Cu, Sn, As, Sb, and P.The NANO-S-MART project emerges as a response to this pressing need, focusing on the systematic and in-depth analysis of the impact of residual elements in martensitic steels.

However, the size, cost and scalability of current devices prevents them from reaching their full potential. Photonics is one of the key enabling technologies for quantum technology. In particular, photonics integrated circuits (PICs) with their wafer-level manufacturing based on microfabrication technologies can provide the reduction in size and cost and enable next generation scalable quantum technologies. To fully achieve this goal, an universal PIC technology that can serve most quantum applications is needed.In QU-PIC, we selected the Al2O3 integrated photonics platform as backbone technology for the development of quantum PICs thanks to its excellent low propagation loss performance and wide operating spectral region from the ultraviolet (200 nm) until the mid-infrared. A large range of PIC building blocks is developed in QU-PIC, focusing on areas where materials or integration technologies are not yet available. Several light sources, including multiwavelength tunable lasers with operation at 399 nm, 411 nm and 935 nm on the PIC, UVC external cavity lasers emitting at 280 nm, sources of squeezed photons, single photon detectors, programmable ASICs and the required packaging and assembly technologies will be investigated. An open PDK will group all the developed quantum building blocks to accelerate innovation from the initial idea to an actually manufactured system. Two application demonstrators will be implemented using the developed building blocks, namely a source of GKP states for quantum processing and an atomic clock based on Yb+ ions for quantum sensing. It is the ambition of QU-PIC to secure a full European supply chain to establish Europe’s Sovereignty and manufacturing capabilities in photonics integrated circuits for quantum.|10.3030/101135845|Cluster 4

From a health and societal perspective, the number of colonoscopies is bound to increase as they are the only way to screen patients for early cancer detection. Many European countries have national screening programs. This is a very big market in need of improved technology.IRE enables a new generation of intelligent robots that through data, simulation and learning can interact with the interior of a living human while communicating with a human operator. The huge variation of human anatomy and the dynamic effect of human physiology make it a complicated navigational task to use endoscopes. Entanglement, haemorrhage, and perforation risks create a critical and difficult environment to navigate autonomously in where even trained human operators meet challenges. We exploit one of the largest datasets on real-life colonoscopies with more than 2,000 operations to learn safe navigation, combined with simulated training on a population of biomechanical models of the abdominal region.IRE boosts the design and configuration of the robotic endoscope using digital twins and simulation, and careful inclusion of clinicians will speed up the process of integration. IRE will raise the level of autonomy by building upon simulation, imaging, and learning to yield an increased interpretation and understanding of the complex real- world environments, capable of anticipating the effect of human motions, adapting and replanning to avoid entanglement.|10.3030/101135082|Cluster 4

Massive consumption of chemical pesticides in agriculture is a significant contributing factor. Viticulture ranks high among the crops that depend on a massive consumption of chemical pesticides, consuming approximately sixty percent of the fungicides applied in the EU, making it a priority target for reducing the use of chemical plant protection products. At the same time, grapevine is economically and culturally important in the EU, with wine being the largest EU agri-food sector.Recent advances and new perspectives in grapevine breeding have opened the possibility for GrapeBreed4IPM to address the reduction of fungicides and preserve biodiversity. Lessons learned from past experience in viticulture have shown that success in improving sustainability relies on global involvement of all actors. Therefore, we brought together the top European research groups in grapevine breeding and involved different stakeholders along the grapevine industry value chain in a multi-actor and co-design approach to produce the best insights for maximum impact. The project will develop grapevine varieties with resistance to relevant diseases, adapted to local environmental and pedoclimatic conditions, and with the goal of reducing reliance on chemical pesticides. In addition, the project will provide farmers, winegrowers and advisers with best practices and guidelines for integrated pest management, adapted to disease-resistant varieties, as ingredients for their largest possible adoption and leading to a long-awaited more environmentally friendly and sustainable viticulture in Europe. The project’s outcomes will support evolution of the grapevine market to meet regulatory requirements and consumer expectations, a market that is expected to reach nearly EUR 204 billion by 2025.|10.3030/101132223|Cluster 6

SSD is expected to reduce the consumption of energy radically, leading to 60% energy savings in a drying process, representing ~40% energy savings on the entire production line. It also demonstrates a concept that can lead to CO2 emission-free paper and board manufacturing, and an increase in the share of renewable energy. In a long term, the energy savings potential in Europe is 127 TWh or 6 B€ annually for paper and board manufacturers. In addition to pulp and paper sectors, the developed concepts are expected to be suitable for chemical industry and wood processing applications. Through the developed SteamDry concept, the technology suppliers can increase their market share revenue 230-345 M€ annually in Europe. The global annual energy savings potential is 870 TWh, almost 7x of European energy savings and market potential.The developed solution can be installed on either existing infrastructure or on newbuilt machines with low CAPEX and OPEX creating new opportunities for technology suppliers and savings for the users of this technology. Results ultimately lead to the prosperity of these companies and the CO2-savings targets of the EU. Exploitation potential will be validated through the business cases calculated by technology suppliers and product manufacturers. The piloting of SSD increases knowledge of a) keeping two gas phases, air and steam, separate, b) cleaning superheated steam from biobased particles, c) operating these safely and d) AI-supported advanced control platform.This approach builds on the consortium with strong capabilities to perform the action.

According to the 2023 Circularity Gap Report, the global economy is now only 7.2% circular.  The EU has great potential to convert bio-waste into bio-based products that can be used in multiple bio-applications. This revalorisation can directly support 5-10 times more employment and generate 4-9 times more added value than energy use.Circular Business Models in Bioeconomy (CBMB) face many challenges to become sustainable and profitable. Firstly, primary producers, the owners of the valuable feedstock, are often not integrated into the bioeconomy value chains, and they are often small scale and are fragmented, reducing their ability to negotiate with those higher up the value chain. The result is a suboptimal distribution of benefits and incentives. The main challenges in designing CBMB consist of: -lack of knowledge sharing and collaboration between stakeholders-need for new supply chains and logistical networks-difficult scale up of innovative technologies-understanding of the potential synergies and symbiotic relationships between sectors-overcoming poor public acceptance -complex and fragmented policy schemes, As a result of this, there is a lack of demonstrated and replicable systemic bio-solutions for the territorial deployment of the circular bioeconomy.The PRIMED ProjectPRIMED will co-create innovative forms of cooperation to integrate primary producers in novel bioeconomy value chains with a multi-actor approach. To do so, PRIMED will develop novel CBMB to produce high-value bio-based products through advanced biorefineries, and will demonstrate them in five Living Labs (LLab):PRIMED will also empower multi-actors to co-design a collaborative ecosystem to accelerate the bioeconomy, with an Open Access knowledge hub and toolkit (PRIMED digital toolbox).|10.3030/101135353|Cluster 6

The MoWiLife consortium addresses this call with the most advanced technology. Basis for the four MoWiLife pilots is a 2.3 kV SiC MOSFET, which will be developed by project partner Infineon. It includes a source-gate PiN diode, whose on-state voltage has a strong temperature dependence and can be read out by the gate drive, which will be developed by Rostock University. In addition, self-protection features will be integrated into the SiC chip for robustness and direct water cooling will be realized for higher output power.Two wind energy converter pilots are being realized in MoWiLife by two industrial partners. As one of the technology leaders in wind energy, Vestas – supported by University of Aalborg – will realize a TRL 6 SiC converter with +20% power density and digital-twin Condition and Health Monitoring. The start-up RKL together with Rostock University will develop a TRL 5 wind energy power stack with Condition and Health Monitoring based on online chip temperature and on-state voltage measurement.Solar medium voltage DC collection grids and meshed high voltage transmission grids will play an important role in the future.

The maximum power that can be extracted from a planar wave is proportional to the wave period and to the square of the wave amplitude but, to extract this power, the hydrodynamic parameters of the Wave Energy Converter must be modified and this means having the availability of producing high reactive forces. The proposed Reciprocating Superconducting Generator (RSG) is simpler than other existing superconducting generators due to the fact that its alternating movement allows the direct integration into wave energy converters where the primary energy source is also moving in a reciprocating way. This RSG consists of a Circular Switched Reluctance Machine housed inside a flexible moving cryostat with bellows, avoiding the need of any feedthrough for any moving part. The machine is cooled down using a Cryogenic Supply System (CSS) which recirculates helium gas through the coils and the radiation screen and current leads at two different temperatures.The project proposes to build a full system prototype to be tested at the laboratory scale and to analyse its implementation into two existing WEC systems developed by two technologists participating in the project.A set of the prototype generator coils will be made from MgB2 superconducting technology, while the other one will use REBCO tapes. The achieved results for different temperatures will be compared. In both cases the proposed technology will profit from the latest advances in superconductivity and very specifically in recent developments in superconducting magnet technology provided by six of the participants, including the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), a world leader in such activities, in a perfect example of bringing the forefront technologies to social applications.|10.3030/101172746|Cluster 5

Urethral strictures affect approximately 0.6% of the male population, leading to persistent physical and psychological impairment in patients and imposing a significant economic burden on healthcare systems. The lack of effective techniques to heal and repair diseased urethras emphasises the urgent need to invest in innovative regenerative approaches. In this direction, bioprinting offers promising prospects through the production of customised tissue constructs with controlled cell composition and architecture. However, there is still a significant gap between laboratory studies and clinical application, which is why there is currently no reliable technology available for clinical use. STRONG-UR includes the development of modular, scalable bioprinter components and bioinks to bridge the current gap. The bioinks comprise smart hydrogels customisable to personalised urethral constructs, supporting desired cellular functions and enabling non-invasive monitoring for real-time treatment assessment. Two different approaches are proposed: a single stage in situ bioprinting approach for accelerated clinical translation and a multistage approach using GMP-manufactured components to induce vascularisation and promote tissue healing. In addition, a novel bioprinted in vitro urethral model is proposed as a human-based testing platform for more ethical and reliable preclinical assessments.

This approach has notable drawbacks, including a lack of insight into how changes at one level impact the overall aerostructure performance and the need to repeat much of the certification process if changes are made at distant levels.To address these challenges, the pAIramid project proposes a revolutionary approach based on high-fidelity virtual tests interconnected across the different levels of the certification pyramid. A digital tool is being created, which works by leveraging data-driven simulation methods and Artificial Intelligence (AI), aiming to optimize the certification process, reducing computational time, and promoting fast decision-making. This AI-driven hybrid pyramid approach breaks down barriers between different testing levels, easing knowledge transfer and faster design iterations.The pAIramid project is completed with several industrial demonstrators, which will help to check the proper performance of the digital tool while proving that it is able to effectively bring in new solutions to the aerostructures’ field. Four different use cases, all of them focused on advancing technologies related to composites’ properties (functionalized thermosets and thermoplastics) and manufacturing processes (one-shot LRI and FDM with continuous fiber reinforcement) are analyzed. All of them will be matured up to TRL4, counting with relevant collaboration of RTOs and industrial partners, which give these technologies the potential to be deployed in the market in the coming years, as well as representing valuable information for the tool learning, which will continue growing thanks to already existing and newly created data, while spreading in the market.|10.3030/101192736|Cluster 5

Focusing on floods in the Greater Horn of Africa and floods and tropical cyclones in Madagascar, we seek to improve the ways climate services are produced, disseminated and used for making short-term and long-term decisions to diminish climate risk. Our strategy is to mitigate five obstacles to climate adaptation: 1) Temporal and spatial mismatches and lack of relevance of climate services; 2) Capacity to implement coping strategies and access to climate services; 3) Governance barriers, including fragmentation of responsibility; 4) Climate change, which can make existing coping strategies obsolete; 5) Lack of evidence on the socioeconomic impacts of climate services. Our consortium is highly multidisciplinary. Social science is strongly represented in our cross-cutting co-production activities, which involve working with peer communities consisting of actors from multiple sectors including policymakers, and community work with 100 vulnerable villages in Madagascar. Our rigorous assessment of the added value of climate services-based interventions in these villages will also be led by social scientists. Climate scientists will steer the co-production of national and regional operational early warning systems and work to enhance the skill of a subseasonal forecast model system. All the partners will be involved in an extensive training and capacity-building programme, which targets vulnerable communities, consortium members including national and regional meteorological services. Our consortium has 14 partners, with strong representation from Africa. It involves actors from all parts of the climate services ecosystem. The reason for mobilising such a broad alliance is to ensure that services and protocols are developed locally, which enables our outcomes to be sustained beyond the lifetime of ACACIA.|10.3030/101137847|Cluster 5

Our strategy: Four evidence-based strategies, which will be adapted to context through a co-design process: 1) urban farming in schools with satellite farms and organic waste composting, 2) sustainable health modules for classrooms, 3) linking to healthcare workers through health talks using motivational interviewing techniques and 4) WHO Best Buys: Mass media campaign. Our evaluation: 3 cluster-RCTs in secondary schools, within the framework of urban Health & Demographic Surveillance Systems, implementation, process evaluation & cost-effective evaluation. Our expected results: Evidence of how to implement and scale a sustainable health intervention. Estimate a mean difference in BMI of 0.175 which could lead to reduction of 5% in the prevalence of obesity.|10.3030/101137359|Cluster Health

Multiple stressors such as climate change and pollution from local and remote sources affect human life, wildlife and the ecosystems of the Arctic. These are inseparably connected and require a holistic approach to analyses and assessments of pollution issues, and to their solutions. Using this One Health approach, ArcSolution will provide knowledge and mitigating solutions, co-created with the people of the Arctic. The Arctic is home to a variety of Arctic communities. To capture this diversity, ArcSolution will work in four Arctic locations, i.e. Northern Finland, Svalbard, Northern Norway (Tromsø) and Greenland, integrating local and Indigenous knowledge with environmental, health, technical and social science research in a One Health approach. The One Health framework will be instrumental in identifying knowledge and data gaps, and in synthesizing the information generated and collected in ArcSolution. In addition to scientifically relevant priority pollutants (e.g. per-/polyfluorinated alkylated substances, mercury, (micro)plastics and their additives, and key pathogens), ArcSolution will provide room for research and citizen science projects on locally prioritized issues. We will study pollution from local and remote sources in a climate change context, pollutant accumulation in food webs and human exposure. We will also evaluate current and predict future impacts of these pollutants on Arctic ecosystems and human health. Together with the local communities, we will develop solutions in the fields of circular economy, technology and chemicals management. Our results will be used in education programmes at Arctic schools already connected to ArcSolution. They will be communicated to policy-makers, industry and the scientific community. The One Health-based knowledge will strengthen the knowledge base and contribute to sustainable preventive actions for human life, wildlife and the ecosystems in the Arctic.|10.3030/101135051|Cluster 6

Power-to-X methods are promising due to their negligible discharge rate but up to now all the efforts have been based on the use of H2 obtained by electrolysis, and the TEAs have shown that the high cost of the electrolysers hinders greatly its possibilities of industrial use.EffiTorch aims at developing an alternative breakthrough technology for Power-to-X based on the direct splitting of CO2, using an ultra-high temperature thermal plasma, with the simultaneous valorisation of low value bio-waste, leading to the efficient  production of syngas. EffiTorch aims to reach carbon efficiencies higher than 90% and energy efficiencies higher than 60%, outperforming the best solutions available presently.Some of the research groups in Effitorch have a vast experience in CO2 splitting using Microwave (MW) plasma torches. Nevertheless, recently  a compound approach that combines CO2 splitting by thermal plasmas with a quenching using the very endothermic reverse Bouduard reaction (RBR) has been developed in China that  vastly improves the promising results obtained  in the splitting of CO2 , while solving one of the yet unresolved issues, that of the efficient separation of the gases obtained. EffiTorch aims to explore the possibilities offered by a much improved version of the experimental set-ups used by the Chinese groups, including additional sophistications like the ultrasonic atomization of a bio-oil obtained by Hydrothermal Liquefaction (HTL) from sewage sludge, the use of high temperature reactors with plasma confinement and the implementation of a secondary heating of the plasma by induction with HF frequency (100-400 KHz), that could improve the energy efficiency and reduce costs.|10.3030/101172766|Cluster 5

Personalised medicine, comprising tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, monitoring and treatment is essential to reduce the burden of disease and improve the quality of life. Integration of multiple data types (multimodal data) into artificial intelligence models is required for the development of accurate and personalised interventions. This is particularly true for the inclusion of genomic data, which is information-rich and individual-specific, and more routinely available as the cost of sequencing continues to fall. Multimodal data integration is complex due to privacy & governance requirements, the presence of multiple standards, distinct data formats, and underlying data complexity and volume. NextGen tools will remove barriers in data integration several cardiovascular use cases. NextGen deliverables will include tooling for multimodal data integration and research portability, extension of secure federated analytics to genomic computation, more effective federated learning over distributed infrastructures, more effective and accessible tools for genomic data analysis; improved clinical efficiency of variant prioritisation; scalable genomic data curation; and improved data discoverability and data management.

Usual care comprises oral anticoagulation and rate control. However, it is unclear, whether existing interventions for early rhythm control reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in these vulnerable patients. EAST-STROKE (Early treatment of Atrial fibrillation for Stroke prevention Trial in acute STROKE) is set out to tackle and reduce the individual and societal burden of death and disability by providing evidence for effective secondary prevention using readily available interventions in these patients. To this end, EAST-STROKE is an investigator-initiated, prospective, randomized, open, blinded endpoint assessment (PROBE) multi- trial to test whether early rhythm control therapy prevents adverse cardiovascular outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke and atrial fibrillation compared to usual care. Up to 1,746 patients will be enrolled. Trial organisation relies on a network of experienced clinical researchers, patient representatives and Health Economics experts. Outcome evaluation will involve a comprehensive array of clinical and safety parameters, health and socio-economic outcomes including patient reported outcome measures. We will also perform cost-effectiveness analyses to address the needs of payers and ease implementation into reimbursement schemes. The project addresses a major health burden and will provide evidence for more effective prevention of adverse outcomes in an area of high public health need. We expect that the results of EAST-STROKE will be implemented rapidly throughout Europe, will support health equity, and will prevent more than 150 thousand recurrent strokes or adverse cardiovascular outcomes over a period of five years. By this, EAST-STROKE will lead to significant cost-savings to European health systems and societies.|10.3030/101156541|Cluster Health

PREMIO COLLAB strives to facilitate improved patient care and streamlined clinical workflows addressing the needs of patients, healthcare professionals, and society.Response evaluation methods for patients with MBC have not been modernised for decades, although molecular imaging with FDG-PET/CT has emerged as a highly accurate method for staging MBC, and staging and monitoring MBC has a profound influence on treatment options and the chances of survival. Furthermore, the patient perspective has rarely been considered, although continuous response evaluation in a monitoring setting has interacted with the life of MBC patients for years. Still, no specific recommendations are provided internationally for response evaluation in MBC or in the overall management of monitoring. PREMIO COLLAB offers complementary competencies in an interdisciplinary collaborative effort to lift this complex task. In a pragmatic multicenter randomised clinical trial (RCT), we will apply the intervention of FDG-PET/CT-based monitoring and compare it with conventional CT as state-of-the-art. The objectives are to analyse the impact of the intervention on overall survival and quality of life in patients with MBC and include cost-effectiveness analyses directly informing HTA agencies and health policymakers. Building on knowledge from the RCT, we will use participatory research designs to develop improved and modernised patient pathways and digital workflows. AI-based solutions in imaging and liquid biopsies constitute perspectives with a broader horizon.The work will be done in multiple European centres and living labs with patient representatives, clinicians, and relevant stakeholders aiming to provide knowledge for updated recommendations with a view to subsequent clinical implementation.This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on ‘‘Diagnostics and Treatment (diagnostics).”|10.3030/101136812|Cluster MISS

SRS are a key enabler for developing ultra-efficient propulsion systems that drastically reduce GHG emissions by 2035 and achieve the EU's target to be climate-neutral by 2050. The advancements will boost design process capabilities and reduce product development cycles.  Future engine concepts require opening up the design space and solving complex design problems out of reach for today's standard industrial design processes within the required timeframe. To achieve the necessary step change in engine design, a similar step change is needed for the design approach. Sci-Fi-Turbo fills this urgent need by exploiting opportunities in three foundation technologies: High-performance computing, high-order numerical methods, and AI/ML. The combination is used to implement and demonstrate two key advancements. First, a highly integrated high-order SRS design process is established for modern CPU/GPU hardware, meeting robustness, accuracy, and turnaround time requirements. It will provide increased functionality and effectivity at an industrial level and pave the way for the uptake of SRS-based design by the industry. The high accuracy of the methodology will also reduce the need for low-TRL testing and enable new concepts and extended operating conditions. Second, an SRS-assisted multi-fidelity, data-driven optimisation framework is developed, which embeds and exploits the advantages of highly accurate high-order SRS while leveraging AI/ML methods to increase the predictive capability of lower-fidelity simulations and maximize overall process accuracy and speed. Dedicated experiments support the technology advancement and will enable the design of net-zero-emission engines in due time and contribute to the digital transformation of the aviation industry.|10.3030/101138080|Cluster 5

Despite this, the implementation of the evidence-based WHO Best Buys policies for NCDs prevention in the African region has been found to be off-track. Additionally, less attention has been given to adolescents and yet this is a period in life where behavioural patterns of NCDs risk factors are established and track into adulthood. There is also a gap in our understanding on how to implement and scale up effective diet and physical activity interventions in real world settings in SSA.Our project therefore aims to reduce two important modifiable risk factors for NCDs: unhealthy diets and physical inactivity and their underlying social determinants among adolescents (aged 10-19 years) living in  mixed socio-economic urban communities in two SSA countries (Ghana & Kenya) by designing, deploying, and evaluating strategies for implementation of evidenced and theory based interventions mapped on to the WHO Best Buys. We selected the two countries because they represent different cultural contexts of nutrition transition (East and West Africa), and both countries are undergoing rapid economic development, urbanisation and increases in NCD prevalence. The intervention delivery will take a multi-sectoral approach to increasing the capability, opportunity and motivation of adolescents to eat healthier and be more physically active. We will focus on three settings to enhance the reach: secondary schools and, family/community/faith-based settings and the digital environment using social media. Together, this project will increase opportunities, awareness, knowledge and health literacy, motivate adolescents to increase self-efficacy, guide self-regulatory actions and adopt positive health behaviour (such as dissuasion from physical inactivity and sedentary behaviours, or unhealthy food choices) to prevent NCDs.|10.3030/101095375|Cluster Health

However, acknowledging the long-term limitations in biomass supply, as highlighted by the European Commission in the EU Bioeconomy Strategy Progress Report (2022), there is an urgent need for the development of advanced bioinspired technologies that mimic nature but exhibit higher efficiency.The S2B project aims to unlock the potential of photosynthetic microbes for the direct conversion of solar energy and CO2 into butanol by employing innovative concepts and approaches. Specifically, S2B will transfer the microbial production of butanol from conventional suspension cultivation to a tailored solid-state biocatalytic platform. In this platform, engineered thin-layer assemblies of cyanobacteria and bio-based matrix materials will synergistically enable the redistribution of cell resources, such as energy and carbon flows, towards butanol formation. Simultaneously, S2B will improve light management, enhance CO2 capture efficiency, and facilitate downstream processes by separating butanol from the production medium. Consequently, the primary technological innovation of S2B will be the continuous, long-term direct solar butanol production by photosynthetic cell factories acting as biocatalysts.The process will be integrated with waste effluent and direct air capture, covering the entire value chain from light harvesting and CO2 capture to product separation through the circular economy concept.

Methanol has great potential to be one of the selected low-carbon fuels for heavy road and transportation and marine freight. Technologies that are using methanol as fuel are gaining more momentum and attention globally. However, two key issues may challenge the further uptake of methanol in energy systems: i) methanol is today produced from fossil resources, and ii) methanol is used mainly by chemical industries, leaving small room for the energy sector to count on it. Bio-MeGaFuel is proposing a novel route that converts low value biomass to methanol via an intensified process with a minimum carbon footprint comparable to conventional methods. Bio-MeGaFuel uses chemical looping gasification to produce clean syngas from biomass, and membrane reactor technology to directly produce methanol from syngas. A key feature of Bio-MeGaFuel is the possibility to maximize the conversion of hydrogen and carbon (via CO2 recirculation) from biomass waste to methanol with the minimum number of process steps. The process is based on the conversion of biomass waste aimed at increasing the capacity of biomethanol production in a sustainable way and addressing the increasing demand for biomethanol as a fuel. Bio-MeGaFuel is underpinned by technologies that are being developed to TRL 5 by an expert consortium. Besides, it is backed by a strong reference group including the business leaders and market players in biomass supply, whole methanol production value chain, potential end users, and potential future players in the production, management, and distribution of biomethanol.

It will do so by exploiting newly available climate simulations and Earth Observations (EOs), and by combining machine learning (ML) with physical methods. The research will target fundamental knowledge gaps related to atmospheric circulation and land-atmosphere interactions, which represent major limitations in current climate predictions and projections, and in particular in understanding changes in European summer extremes.To underpin the research, and benefitting the wider research community, EXPECT will develop tools to efficiently analyse a variety of large data sets in combination that are hosted in different repositories across institutions. This will facilitate the exploitation of recent investments into high-resolution climate models and EO data. EXPECT will further build data science capacity for the scientifically robust, efficient and reproducible analysis of the massive data assets, including novel ML approaches, and provide training for the climate science community and the next generation of researchers in particular.EXPECT will thus deliver significant scientific and technological advances for society and the climate science community that will last well beyond the project, in support of WCRP’s strategic objectives.|10.3030/101137656|Cluster 5

The project will target the factors and processes responsible for reproducing political inequalities in youth engagement in deliberative and participatory processes based on intergenerational and intragenerational power imbalances and youth intersectional positionalities. The goal is to offer policymakers, public servants, researchers, teachers, youth workers, facilitators of deliberative processes, and youth CSOs concrete instruments, guidelines, and solutions to renovate deliberative and participatory practices implemented in public governance and schools. The consortium of nine partners, consisting of seven universities, the ALDA European network of local democracies, and an SME focusing on communication and dissemination, will contribute multidisciplinary and multi-methodological expertise in psychology, education, sociology, political science, gender studies, social research, intersectionality, and media analysis. A Stakeholders’ Collaborative Network, including expert advisors, local municipality representatives, schools, civil society, and youth organisations, will also be engaged throughout the project. Together, they will: (a) enhance the inclusivity of deliberative practices in two local municipalities (in Italy and Finland); (b) design, test, and deliver an innovative, co-constructed intersectional approach called the Intersectional Participatory Action Research-and-Deliberation, piloted in seven local municipalities and four schools (in Italy, Portugal, the UK, and Denmark); (c) design participatory formats; (d) create tools; (e) define ethical guidelines. By improving the democratic quality, inclusiveness, effectiveness, and legitimacy of deliberative and participatory processes, the project will contribute to greater social justice for all youth.|10.3030/101132459|Cluster 2

The ELBEX (Extracted Lepton Beam at the European XFEL) proposal builds on this strength and will set up new opportunities for European scientists and innovators, by providing an extracted high energy electron beam for experiments. With ELBEX we propose a pathfinder project to demonstrate the feasibility of such a facility at the European XFEL. This unique new possibility would strengthen the global competitiveness of the European Research Area and create opportunities for new user groups.The high energy, high charge density and excellent quality of the electron beam, if brought into interaction with a strong laser beam, opens up the study of a range of scientific topics, most prominently, of strong field Quantum Electrodynamics (QED).  For the first time, the Schwinger limit for the electromagnetic field strength, at which non-perturbative QED effects become relevant, could be reached experimentally  in this facility. Studying the particles created in the photon beam dump opens up the possibility to search for feebly interacting particles, complementing current or planned experiments like FASER II or SHiP. In addition, the electron beam itself is at the centre of a range of highly relevant and ambitious experiments in the area of accelerator science and detector science. Within the ELBEX project, the installation of a facility to extract an electron beam from the European XFEL using a fast kicker magnet and to transport it into a multi-purpose experimental area will be prepared. On the condition that a positive decision by the European XFEL council is reached to grant an extended 12-week XFEL shutdown, the installation of the ELBEX facility is an option.|10.3030/101130174|Other

Administrative overburdening arises from a continuous increase in the number of rules that require implementation and the relative stagnation in administrative capacities. This discrepancy between the rules up for implementation and the administrative resources available results in suboptimal policy outcomes, low-quality public services, and inconsistent implementation practices. In view of this assessment, it is the central objective of SUPA to examine strategies for enhancing the capabilities of the public sector to cope with the escalating challenges of administrative overburdening. To this end, SUPA pursues two interrelated objectives: The first one is to examine how decision-making procedures and practices can be improved to limit the overall burdens placed on the administration. The second goal is to explore how administrative structures can be reformed to manage ongoing rule growth effectively. SUPA examines patterns of rule growth and the resulting administrative changes and challenges in six European States (Denmark, France, Germany, Norway, Spain and the Netherlands) and the European Union. Based on a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods, SUPA (1) evaluates the effectiveness of so-called """"rule-offsetting"""" schemes; (2) investigates how legislators can embed legal design principles to prevent unintended rule growth cascades; (3) assesses how policy growth affects the underlying administrative structures; and (4) examines citizens' experience and operational challenges linked to different ways of distributing implementation burdens across public authorities. SUPA has formed collaboration agreements with multiple public authorities, ensuring that the Consortium's findings can be directly transferred to both policy-makers and administrators in the field."""|10.3030/101177315|Cluster 2

The project covers the entire arc of development from empirical research into how people with disabilities – as forerunners of technology use – perform tasks and interact at work, to theoretical innovation regarding the nature of socio-material assemblages as well as what constitutes technology, to policy recommendations, and to the development of new technological solutions, including AI-based technologies. We consider people with disabilities to be experts in using technical systems to improve their work performance, and through an analysis of a variety of use cases, will identify elements of successful use as well as factors that cause problems for interaction or the performance of tasks. Empirical results will also be generated by surveys and co-creation activities. People with disabilities will be engaged in NewWorkTech in line with the principle “nothing about us without us”. NGO partners will be actively involved as facilitators in the empirical research and as drivers of application and dissemination. Through our own technological development effort, attention to the ethical use of technologies, and the dissemination of the knowledge we generate, the results will feed into improved usage methods and functionality of work-related technologies, as well as knowledge about the required skills. The smart use of technology thus achieved will help create employment opportunities for people with disabilities, improving their quality of life and reducing inequalities while also helping alleviate the current shortage of labour in Europe, and open possibilities for more efficient and creative use of technology by everyone, whether they have physical or cognitive limitations or not.|10.3030/101177176|Cluster 2

To accelerate the transition, next-generation electric motors need to push the existing boundaries in terms of efficiency, power density, manufacturability, cost, and environmental sustainability. A reduced and more circular use of rare earth resources is critical to reinforce Europe’s strategic autonomy and establish a more economically sustainable value chain. Recently developed axial flux motor technology based on a yokeless and segmented armature topology yields promising prospects in all these areas, significantly reducing the required amount of rare earth magnet material by design, and combining this with unmatched power density compared to state-of-the-art radial flux machines.CliMAFlux will develop novel concepts (e.g., in terms of excitation and cooling) for more performant (e.g., >35% energy loss decrease in driving cycles) axial flux motors, thus reducing the need for rare earth materials by 60%, leveraging high-fidelity multiphysics models (e.g., electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, and at the system level) and digital twins. Innovative designs and manufacturing processes will be proposed to: (i) increase the power density to >23 kW/l, through novel materials and improved thermal behaviour; (ii) enhance circularity over the lifetime (including >70% recyclability at the end of life); and (iii) ensure cost competitiveness (50% cost reduction) at mass production level (reaching ~€5/kW). The CliMAFlux on-board motors are integrated with the power electronics and mechanical transmission systems. The resulting electric drives will be managed by robust predictive controllers based on the CliMAFlux digital twins, including artificial intelligence (AI) prediction models, which will also facilitate novel functionalities in vehicle (sub)systems, hereby exploiting the full capability of the complete electrified drivetrain. The individual motor (with focus on approx. 90 kW continuous power) and integrated drive system will be benchmarked over a wider range of vehicles, in terms of both performance and environmental impact, on virtual (X-in-the-Loop with digital twin) and hardware test platforms up to TRL7, i.e., on a research electric vehicle already available at the consortium participants. To achieve these ambitious targets, CliMAFlux brings together the competences of 4 academic partners, 1 industry-oriented RTO, 3 SMEs and 1 LE with dedicated R&D and production facilities in the fields of motor and transmission development, power electronics integration, electrified vehicle systems, automotive design, and life cycle assessment and costing aspects.In summary, CliMAFlux will establish new knowledge and industrial leadership in key digital, enabling and emerging technologies, and, therefore, directly contribute to Europe’s Key Strategic Orientations C and A as well as actively support the transformation towards zero tailpipe emission road mobility (2Zero).|10.3030/101096062|Cluster 5

These applications require miniaturized low power and low-cost gas sensors with good gas selectivity to be integrated in personal devices, in product packaging or in widely distributed sensor networks.AMUSENS aims at developing a gas sensor platform with flexible selectivity to different gas environments by combining a multi-pixel approach and artificial intelligence to adapt the data analysis to the targeted applications. It is based on metal oxide sensing materials on micro-hotplate platform, which are already available on the market for low power applications, but suffer from a lack of selectivity. Gas-selective multi-pixel sensors based on different metal oxide materials have been demonstrated, but their industrialization is limited to few industrially available materials. By using original additive manufacturing approaches for local liquid-phase and gas-phase depositions, we aim at extending the choice of available materials and demonstrate their sustainability in wafer-scale processing. Artificial intelligence will be used both to accelerate the choice of materials and for data fusion to determine specific patterns in the gas analysis. Two specific applications targeting personal exposure and health care will demonstrate the adaptability of the platform, based on an analysis of the users' requirements.The proposed architecture will be adaptable to many applications (i) from the flexibility in choosing the materials, made possible by the local deposition techniques, and (ii) from the programming protocol of the artificial intelligence. This approach of products with on-demand properties will improve the resilience of the gas sensor industry by accelerating the time to market of products with enhanced performances.|10.3030/101130159|Cluster 4

However, several European education systems are regularly pointed out as being underperforming, inequitable or segregated. The core objective of the 4-year MTSS-K project is to adapt, implement and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of a promising American educational approach for kindergarten in five European countries. The so-called Multi-Tiered System of Support (MTSS) aims at reducing inequalities by training teachers to improve the socio-emotional, literacy and numeracy skills of all students and more particularly of the most vulnerable ones. This model calls to adopt evidence-based teaching practices and to regularly and monitor students’ progress on the basis of objective data (Tier 1); to provide early and more intensive group interventions to students who do not progress as expected (Tier 2); and to provide even more intensive interventions to students who continue to need it (Tier 3). This model has been shown to improve equal opportunities of school success and inclusion by significantly diminishing the number of students with learning and behavior difficulties and referred to special education services. However, data is missing as regards comprehensive implementation of this model, its efficacy in kindergarten, its applicability in the European educative systems, and the cost-benefit ratio of this measure. In addition to fill these gaps, the MTSS-K project also aims at making accessible for stakeholders, schools and teachers on a dedicated free-access website evidence-based syntheses, intervention tools, and skills’ assessment instruments developed for the study, to disseminate the results and data in the perspective of the open-science framework, and to make policy recommendations for EU and national authorities.|10.3030/101132586|Cluster 2

Cryogenic propellant combinations such as oxygen / methane offer higher specific impulses than storable combinations, but their low saturation temperatures raise additional challenges with respect to preventing their evaporation during long-term storage. While the ability to refuel craft with cryogenic propellants would allow for longer-term manned missions to Mars and the Moon, as well as aid in the improvement of in-space sustainability, preventing the evaporation of the propellants during the transfer process also poses challenges. As of today, neither long-term storage nor refuelling with cryogenic propellants has been demonstrated in-orbit. CRYSALIS will develop and mature the technologies needed for the management of cryogenic propellant for future space transportation and in-orbit servicing activities. This maturation will include performing a small-scale in-orbit demonstration to mature those whose performance can only be characterised in a microgravity environment. This will be a closed-system demonstrator flown on-board the Nyx capsule, which will aim to not only demonstrate the feasibility of such processes but will aim to improve the understanding of the behaviour of such propellants under microgravity, allowing for development of future systems. These technologies will aid in ensuring the independent access of the EU to space, in particular to manned and heavy missions beyond GEO and LEO, by supporting the development of a logistical network of craft, depots, and hubs, required for cis-lunar and future Martian missions.|10.3030/101135431|Cluster 4

However, EAF production of sheet steel is currently not a reality due to the effect of undesired residual elements in the scrap.The aim of CiSMA is to introduce scrap-based EAF steel products into mass-market sheet metal consumer goods with high-quality requirements, currently served with BOF steel (96 % of the market).First, by generating fundamental knowledge on how residual elements, and Copper in particular, interact with sheet Steel and its performance. This will be done combining state-of-the-art methodologies with specialized resources, such as Synchrotron, to design Steel grades and determine safe residual thresholds.Next, scrap as a raw material will be studied together with methodologies to improve its quality and maximize the use of low-quality scrap, through the use of techniques that separate undesired inclusions from the main stream of steel.Finally, by generating a toolbox of enabling technologies to introduce recycled sheet metal in the industry: 1) fast characterization tests for quality control, 2) online test methodologies that can be applied in the press floor, and 3) the development of Machine Learning-enhanced Finite Element Modelling and Digital Twin that allow adapting production processes to feedstock with high variability.These developments will be showcased in applying four steel compositions into two pilot trials for mass-market applications: automotive and white goods.

The aim is to provide new quantitative knowledge of the mitigation potential of blue carbon in emerging coastal and oceanic habitats and to assess the scope for their inclusion in carbon accounting at national and international levels. Our approach is to study each step in the biological carbon flow from CO2-capture by primary producers, through transformations and intermediate storage, to long-term sequestration. We will do this by combining analyses of new and existing data at several Arctic and Antarctic Learning Sites and use this to develop and validate new ecosystem models and remote sensing algorithms. These will then be used to provide large-scale assessments of changes in blue carbon habitat distributions and their CO2 capture and sequestration potential, both now and in the future. The new knowledge generated will be presented to the scientific community and to decision makers and managers as policy briefs to guide the designation of marine protected areas that recognize both diversity and blue carbon potential.

Recent research suggests that intratumoral microbiota may contribute to anti-cancer drug resistance, in particular to immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI). However, experimental approaches to address the role of microbiota in human cancers are lacking. Solution: Project ARTURO will ethically tackle this problem by using an innovative state-of-the-art 3D tumor-on-chip (ToC) model, as part of the emerging field of Micro-Physiological Systems (MPS). Plan: The role of patient-derived bacteria, and of their postbiotics and released extra-cellular vesicles, in tumor ecosystem behaviors and drug responses, will be deciphered by integrating clinical data, omics analysis, and novel ToC-based information (by live imaging and single-cell transcriptomics). The development of advanced computational methods to extract ToC-based information constitutes a major force and innovation in the field, with high potential to accelerate future applications of ToC technology in clinics. The focus will be on two frequent poorly-understood cancer subtypes: non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and invasive lobular breast cancer (ILC). End-users’ perspectives will be addressed using a co-design approach to develop ethically sound and evidence-based cancer-related innovation and health policies.Impact: ARTURO results are expected to lead to a deep understanding of processes underpinning tumor-host interactions, helping to conceive novel microbiota-based intervention strategies, in particular for NSCLC and ILC patients. ARTURO will take social, ethnical, cultural, and gender aspects into account, facilitating the translation of ARTURO's innovations to clinical practice and co-design of policies.

The final goal is to realise a robust and scalable technology for microwave squeezing and generation of non-classical microwave radiation based on superconducting (meta)materials. The three specific objectives of the MiSS project are: 1) Technological innovation, investigating new material and scalable microfabrication approaches to optimise the building blocks to produce Travelling Wave Parametric Amplifiers-based squeezers; 2) Metrology protocols, developing dedicated cryogenic measurement protocols to accurately evaluate the radiation quantumness, opening the way to standardisation; 3) Realisation of a prototype for real world applications, developing a system with scalability potential for distributed quantum sensing in the microwave regime. A use-case dedicated to multi-parameter sensing for material characterisation will be targeted. The outcomes of this project will pave the way towards real exploitation of quantum-enhanced sensing techniques in the microwave regime. The MiSS consortium brings together a unique set of expertise in design, materials, metrology, fabrication, cryogenic characterisation and commercialisation to be able to deliver on this ambitious goal.|10.3030/101135868|Cluster 4

The tunable analog front-end (AFE) interface should be enabled at the fine-grain level by emerging reconfigurable field effect transistor (RFET) and negative differential resistance (NDR) transistor technologies that provide co-integration capabilities with European 22nm CMOS processing technologies allowing for a More-than-Moore sensor technology approach. Being doping-free these two key enabling technologies provide a high potential gain for a large variety of sensor system requiring a low 1/f noise behavior ranging from solid-state sensors, such as photodiodes, to environmental monitoring for the automotive market, and physiological signal monitoring, such as cancer detection. Having naturally un-gated channel areas, reconfigurable field effect transistors are the perfect target vehicle for functionalized surfaces, e.g. for the detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) biomarkers, serving as a Reconfigurable Sensor Transducer (RST) for the healthcare sector. Together with the AFE, these transducers can be integrated into a CMOS as a use-case demonstration of the flexible platform. To sum up, in SENSOTERIC we will investigate smart sensing solutions in environmental monitoring and healthcare, where both the RST and the AFE utilize the capabilities of emerging RFET and NDR key enabling technologies.|10.3030/101135316|Cluster 4

Quantum technologies are expected to further push sensor’s performances, unlocking even more application domains, exploiting non-classical correlation of light and matter to extract the relevant information beyond the limit dictated by classical noise processes, improving performances such as sensitivity, specificity and uncertainty. The ability to produce, control and measure quantum states in transportable devices is the key to extend the sensors’ operating environment, lifetime, power consumption and costs. QUANTIFY fits perfectly this vision and the goal of Demonstrating quantum sensing beyond classical capabilities for real-world applications, in the Strategic Research Agenda of the Quantum Flagship Program. QUANTIFY objective consists in bringing photonic quantum enhanced sensors at the next level of integration developing the essential building blocks and novel quantum-enhanced techniques for future chip scale optical clocks, optically pumped magnetometers and optomechanical temperature sensors. QUANTIFY leverages different photonic platforms combined by a novel hybrid integration technique to bring the key optical and optomechanical functionalities on a single chip. To increase the clock and magnetometer performances, we introduce a photonic integrated squeezed light source, also becoming an important step for realizing a universal quantum computer based on photonics. Finally, we demonstrate a novel absolute temperature sensor with an extended detection range, from cryogenic to room temperature leveraging a nanoscale optomechanical approach coupling photonic and phononic degrees of freedom. All the free developed sensors will be assessed using metrological protocols and national primary standards in National metrological laboratories, to foster their feature exploitation in real application for end-users.|10.3030/101135931|Cluster 4

DigiCell provides a digitally integrated framework that improves reliability and quality in the manufacturing processes of high-performance Lithium-ion batteries (LIB) and beyond Lithium battery technologies through unified and adaptive models capturing the structure-property relationships in these complex energy materials. It is based on a toolset of innovative and state-of-the-art characterisation methods for multiscale materials, interoperable tests, and analytical models supported by and linked through machine learning. With this, the production costs, materials waste, and the CO2 footprint in production lines will be reduced, while in parallel the battery electrochemical performance at the single cell level will be increased. The new measurement tools and multi-scale modelling algorithms lead to a higher characterisation speed (factor of 5) and an improved accuracy in cell tests by an order of magnitude, as will be demonstrated on the lab bench and in pilot lines. DigiCell develops a new holistic approach for open-source algorithms and data standardization strategies; new quality assessments for a healthy, safe, and circular economy.

In addition, the growing amount of air traffic means that many EU citizens are still exposed to high noise levels. Intensified research and innovation activities are therefore needed to reduce all aviation impacts and emissions (CO2 and non-CO2, noise, manufacturing) for the EU to reach its policy goals towards a net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. One of the main levers to decrease CO2 emissions is to reduce the airframe structural weight. As an answer, FALCON’s ambition is to enhance the design capabilities of the European industrial aircraft sector, focusing on fluid-structure interaction (FSI) phenomena to improve the aerodynamic performances of aircraft (unsteady loads). Specifically, FALCON aims to develop high-performance, predictive and multi-disciplinary tools for FSI in aeronautics, in order to reduce the aeroacoustics and aeroelastic instabilities using multi-fidelity optimization. This will also benefit to specific noise emissions generated by flexible and mobile airframe structures when exposed to both low and high-speed fluid flows.To achieve its ambitious goal, FALCON assembles a unique interdisciplinary environment of fifteen public and private institutions and their affiliated entities (from renowned research institutions to SMEs and aircraft high-tier suppliers and integrators) to cover all the required scientific and know-how expertise. Building upon three industrial testcases and tight links with key European partnerships such as Clean Aviation, FALCON delineates a high-impact/low-risk proposal that will significantly contribute to the digital transformation of the European aircraft supply chain.|10.3030/101138305|Cluster 5

However, the presence of different contaminants, mainly coming from the emissions of our own Galaxy, constitutes one of the major limiting factors to constrain reliably the existence of the B-modes. Indeed, the success of future CMB polarization experiments lies in the improved understanding and removal capability of foreground emissions.RadioForegrounds+ will provide a state-of-the art description of the highly complex properties of the polarised radio emission from our Galaxy, in particular the synchrotron and the anomalous microwave emissions, as well as of the population of radio sources. It will also provide an unprecedentedly thorough description of the intensity signal. This goal can only be achieved by combining the ESA’s Planck satellite maps (30-857GHz) with the unique low frequency experiments considered in this proposal: QUIJOTE (10-40 GHz), C-BASS (5 GHz) and S-PASS (2.3 GHz), by counting within the consortium with experts on the previous data sets (including the teams responsible for QUIJOTE and C-BASS) and by using the most advanced analysis techniques.The combination of these datasets will provide high-level data products, that will range from more complete radio catalogues, including fainter sources and additional frequency coverage, to new component separated maps in wider regions of the sky. These new data products and models will be made available to the scientific community through widely-used platforms, increasing the scientific return and the impact of the project. We will also provide forecasts of the impact of radio foregrounds on the detectability of the B-mode of polarization for future CMB experiments. The resulting analyses will play a key role in preparing and supporting future international CMB missions as LiteBIRD or ground-based efforts as CMB-S4.|10.3030/101135036|Cluster 4

However, this type of instrument generally includes a complex laser system which has led in the past to significant delays of several European payloads (e.g. ADM-Aeolus, EarthCARE or MERLIN). HALLOA targets the development of a hybrid laser architecture, less complex than current free-space lasers, for greenhouse gas monitoring by Lidar. This laser architecture combines the advantages of fiber-based systems (compact and alignment-free) with those of free-space direct generation systems (high power). This development aims to reach the genuine optical performance for Lidar CO2/H2O monitoring from space and, for independency purpose, to use EU-only components/sub-systems. HALLOA will:1- Develop new EU industrial capabilities and reach EU independency for two key critical sub-systems of the hybrid laser: the 2,05 µm pulsed fiber amplifier and the high-power laser diode at 793 nm2- Space qualify to TRL6, the pulsed fiber amplifier at 2.05µm and the high-power laser pump diode at 793 nm3- Demonstrate experimentally that a complete hybrid laser system, built with EU-only components/sub-systems, can meet the space-mission requirements for Lidar CO2/H2O monitoring.Finally, HALLOA will provide a technical roadmap to establish a European supply chain for the 2µm hybrid-laser system for Lidar application, including a business plan for commercial exploitation of the pulsed fiber amplifier at 2µm and a strategy for space mission insertion.The project involves 6 entities, including 3 non-profit research entities (ONERA, LMD, LZH), 2 industry key-players (KEOPSYS, LPI) and 1 SME (ERDYN). It will pave the way for building a cutting-edge and competitive European supply-chain. The TRL6 demonstration of a hybrid laser system in the eye-safe region for Lidar CO2 measurements will represent a major step forward for EU technological independence in this domain.|10.3030/101189970|Cluster 4

However, the complex phenomena at different length and time scales often limit the development of new magnetic materials and devices. The goal of this project is to develop a magnetic multiscale modeling suite that will allow the design and optimisation of magnetic materials and devices based on multiscale modelling, characterisation, and numerical optimisation. To achieve interoperability between software and analysis tools, we will establish a domain ontology for magnetic materials. We will collaborate with EU magnet industry to create standards for linking simulation software for magnetic materials from first principles simulations and micromagnetics to device level simulators. MaMMoS will use artificial intelligence (AI) to fuse modeling and characterization data. AI methods will identify and correct systematic errors in the simulation data, enabling more accurate predictions. Moreover, AI models can fill gaps where measurements are not available. AI models can also serve as a surrogate in multi-objective optimisation. Optimisation will guide further experiments or simulations, reducing the development time. In MaMMoS, we will apply this approach to speed up the development of permanent magnets with reduced critical elements for electric machines and to optimise the layout of magnetic field sensors for high linearity range. The MaMMoS software will be validated against benchmarks defined according to the industrial requirements for electric machine and sensor design. The multiscale magnetic materials modeling suite will be made open source to enable easy access to high-end simulation tools. Interoperability will facilitate data sharing and reuse among researchers and industries. Interpretable machine learning will reveal insights into the physics and chemistry of magnetic materials and guide the discovery of new materials for the European green deal.|10.3030/101135546|Cluster 4

In this project, the focus will be on problems that affect and can be effected by education only. The rise of English as lingua franca caused other languages to be pushed to the sidelines, leading to situations where pupils are less or even not motivated to learn other languages besides English even if it concerns an official national language of their country. Although multilingual programs like Content and Language Integrated Learning can affect these attitudes, the large majority of these kind of programs also use English as target language, which does not increase the proficiency in other (foreign) languages. A second threat to the linguistic capital has to do with the protection of heritage languages, where we see that the linguistic capital of EU-citizens more and more includes non-EU languages. In schools, homelanguages are often rejected and usage of them is sometimes even punished, leading pupils who are ashamed of their linguistic capital and have a lower sense of belonging.  The increasing popularity of new technologies like ChatGPT and machine translation also threatens to acquisition of languages, as pupils do not feel the need to learn languages any more. At the same time, these new technologies offer many opportunities for teachers in their classrooms. All these treats can be managed via good evidence-based policies at different governance levels and by ensuring teachers receive sufficient training and inspiration on how to accept and stimulate the linguistic capital of pupils. This will be done in this project via intense collaboration with stakeholders at different levels, to ensure that sustainable guidelines, policies and practices can be implemented.|10.3030/101178914|Cluster 2

The differences among patients and the heterogeneous and plastic nature of each individual tumour have resulted in all therapeutic clinical trials failing during the past 20 years. Recently, immunotherapy has been showing great promise, but only in subsets of patients. Identifying those patients cannot be done a priori as biomarkers are still largely missing, nor are we able to follow-up on therapeutic efficacy when patients get treated. The GLIOMATCH project aims at improving the clinical outcome of GBM/pHGG patients by enabling immunology-based patient stratification to empower personalised matching of appropriate immunotherapy, while improving follow-up of clinical responses to existing/novel therapeutics. This will be achieved by integrating spatially resolved, multi-layered tissue maps (using integrated single-cell multiomics), with non-invasive MRI images. This integration will fuel into a novel MRI Radio-multiomics hub, that will be made available to clinical professionals through which they can perform tumour-host based patient stratification and personalised therapy matching while interpreting longitudinal follow-up and treatment efficacy. The proposed data-driven models will be developed by analysing the largest cohort of immuno-oncology (I/O) treated GBM/pHGG patients (n>300, including pre-post treatment samples) with matched controls (n>300) and exceptionally long-term surviving GBM patients (n~140), in which various tumour-host niches will be studied in how they respond to I/O perturbations and lead to improved clinical outcome. This will be empowered by deploying an UNCAN-compatible data lake, to which incremental data collection will be used to further refine the machine learning models, while proposing novel treatment options.

Climate change and urbanization have largely contributed to the dissemination of their mosquito vector and Europe has in recent years been regularly confronted with autochthonous cases. Few vaccines are licensed to prevent flavivirus disease, but the yellow fever 17D (YF17D) vaccine has a unique track record of efficiency and safety. Intriguingly, despite its success, how YF17D induces immunity remains poorly understood. The YELLOW4FLAVI consortium aims to fill the gaps in our understanding of the mechanism of action of this vaccine by linking the structure of the viral particle to the resulting host immune response, in order to learn about optimal vaccine design for flaviviruses in general. Since social acceptance of vaccines is critical for their success, we will also develop optimal communication methods. This will provide us with the tools to tailor vaccine design not only to achieve optimal immune protection, but also to facilitate actual implementation.We are molecular and structural virologists, cell biologists, immunologists, computational scientists, clinicians, and social scientists assembled in a tight collaborative network. To pursue our goal of obtaining a blueprint for determinants of long-lasting immunity for flavivirus vaccine candidates, we will use cutting-edge technologies like cryo-EM, super resolution microscopy, spatial transcriptomics, high-dimensional spectral flow cytometry, single-cell RNA sequencing, advanced cell engineering, small animal models, and clinical studies. In a unique manner, the consortium thereby follows a thread of events from the early response at the site of vaccine injection to the population perception of vaccination, harnessing an enhanced understanding of one of the most successful vaccines of mankind for the development of novel lines of defense against new and old threats.|10.3030/101137459|Cluster Health

Test beds based on field campaign case studies will be developed, along with suitable metrics for tracer transport evaluation, utilising a range of tracers and observations at both global and local scales. These metrics will be employed in the operational CO2MVS to evaluate the implementation of new transport model developments, characterise transport accuracy and representativity in data assimilation, and provide a quality control stamp of tracer transport accuracy. Lastly, CATRINE will provide clear recommendations to the CO2MVS and the Carbon Cycle Community which works with atmospheric inversion models for the evaluation and quality assessment of tracer transport models.|10.3030/101135000|Cluster 4

TipESM assembles the latest Earth System Models (ESMs), including recent improvements to key processes: ice sheets, vegetation and land use, permafrost, marine and terrestrial biogeochemistry. In cooperation with the WCRP/Future-Earth project TIPMIP, TipESM will organise an international collaboration to design and realise a common ESM experiment protocol that will facilitate analysis of the likelihood of occurrence, and potential reversibility, of tipping elements at different levels and duration of global warming. These experiments, will be combined with more project-specific ESM experiments, designed to investigate interactions and feedbacks across the Earth system. Based on the TipESM experiments, existing simulations and observations, we will investigate tipping points, their driving processes, potential early warning signals and cascading effects across the climate, ecosystems and society. Including the most important components of the Earth system in our ESMs will also allow TipESM to identify potentially unknown tipping elements, their precursors and impacts.TipESM brings together expertise from climate science and climate impacts to investigate both the role of gradual climate change for tipping in individual ecosystems and society, and the impact of crossing specific climate tipping points for society, ecosystems, and biodiversity. Project findings will be synthesised into a tipping points risk register. New knowledge and data from TipESM will be regularly communicated to a broad range of research communities, policymakers and the public, contributing to a prepared and resilient society.|10.3030/101137673|Cluster 5

Subsequent syngas cleaning processes are envisaged to ensure a full compatibility of the syngas to the solid oxide fuel cells. NIAGARA’s value chain will feature a very low carbon balance with a strong potential to become carbon negative overtime.NIAGARA will dramatically improve advanced biofuel production by combining complementary scientific and industrial know-how while fostering various promising market applications (e.g., fuel cells). the NIAGARA methodology, which derives from the ambitious idea of producing advanced biofuels from EU-widely available biomasses and wastes on a fully circular basis, making this value chain ultimately sustainable. The main market application that is sought in the NIAGARA project is the generation of electricity using highly efficient SOFC. This implies (i) individually developing key innovative and carbon-efficient processes, (ii) assessing their performances (carbon footprints, energy balance and production yields), and (iii) demonstrating their integration and global compatibility to reach the objective of negative carbon emission on the biofuel production chain up to the generation of electricity.NIAGARA will contribute towards lowering the technological, economic, and social barriers faced by the development of the contemplated processes at TRL5.

This situation is particularly pressing in Northern Europe, where the conservation status of marine habitats in the Kattegat-Skagerrak region is consistently bad. MARHAB’s objective is to improve the conservation status of marine ecosystems by demonstrating an ecosystem dynamics approach to restoration and maintenance of protected habitats. By employing cutting edge technology (genomics, tracking, in situ observations, machine learning) in state-of-art ecosystem research, the project will provide the scientific underpinnings needed to bring about the long overdue reconciliation of fisheries management with biodiversity conservation. Moreover, it will generate a leap in knowledge urgently needed to sustainably manage the productive but severely overexploited ecosystems harboured in the Kattegat-Skagerrak Seas and adjoining coastal waters. MARHAB is urgent, timely and innovative. Urgent, because key habitats and species are in the worst environmental status of the European waters, while European citizens rely on a healthy ocean for climate resilience, and marine resources support livelihoods and food security. Timely, because international agreements such as the 2030 European Biodiversity strategy and the Global Biodiversity Framework (COP15) committed parties to reach important conservation targets in less than 7 years from now, including effectively protecting 30% of the ocean, and 10% with strict protection (in EU). And innovative, because this is a highly understudied region in what concerns marine protection effectiveness. MARHAB engages with the full range of relevant stakeholders at local, regional, national, international, EU and global level. Through a communication strategy tailored to target audiences, MARHAB will contribute to increasing the public and politicians’ understanding of marine biodiversity conservation.|10.3030/101135307|Cluster 6

A dynamic passive controller involves the dynamic control of active energy, i.e. only damping forces. This has been shown to provide a significant increase in power capture relative to optimum linear damping without the requirement to provide additional reactive energy. The performance of this control strategy and associated technologies will be proven by applying it to the Wavepiston wave energy converter; however, it is expected to be equally suitable for a wide range of wave energy converters that utilise a hydraulic PTO. A numerical model of the system will be constructed and used to develop a control strategy designed to minimise the levelized cost of energy, rather than maximise power capture, which is a common, but sub-optimal, objective for many control strategies. The control strategy will first be calibrated and validated using a hardware-in-the-loop test programme and subsequently validated using the Wavepiston offshore test bench at PLOCAN. Two generations of the linear pump and controller valve will be fabricated, designed for mass production with consideration of its full lifecycle impacts (although the actual prototypes may use low volume techniques to limit project costs). The second generation prototypes will be based on learning from experiences and the performance of the first generation. A condition controller designed to increase the remaining useful life and thus reduce the LCOE will also be investigated. This will include identifying condition signatures that indicate a deterioration in one or more components and then using this signature to first estimate the remaining useful life followed by identification of modifications to the control strategy to extend the remaining useful life.|10.3030/101147456|Cluster 5

Observations in the past decades have alerted for the rapid changes in land ice in this region. Record temperatures, melting ice and increased fresh water flux may destabilise the atmosphere and ocean circulation, with severe consequences for regional weather system, sea level rise, and affecting Europe and beyond. An improved understanding of trends and variability of ice evolution is important, and ICELINK will address this challenge by integrating Earth Observation data, in-situ observations and ice flow and climate models into an improved understanding of the processes that control the evolution of glaciers. Through improved understanding of snow, surface mass balance and the ice dynamical response to meltwater runoff, ICELINK will provide new knowledge of the response of Icelandic glaciers and the Greenland ice sheet to global warming and the impacts on climate and ecosystems. ICELINK will engage closely with local communities to co-develop and disseminate new knowledge, needed to support adaptation strategies, mitigate risks and enhance their resilience. A novel approach in ICELINK is to investigate the effect of increasing surface melting on ice evolution of the Greenland Ice Sheet by using Icelandic glaciers as a data-observation laboratory for understanding the response in a warmer world with more melt. The improved models and new insights will feed into the World Climate Research Programme’s Cryosphere Project, IPCC, IPBES, assist development of Copernicus, and support the Destination Earth Initiative.

The application of fertilizers in synergistic combination with biostimulants provides the nutrients required for enhancing the crops yield, while pesticides are used to reduce the risk of loss from plant diseases and weeds on agricultural production. Today, the agricultural sector faces several challenges, namely:- Loss and leaching of fertilisers: Effectiveness of fertilisers must be enhanced through controlled delivery of nutrients ingredients to enhance their availability to the plants for longer periods. - Large amounts of pesticides used: It is necessary to reduce the use of pesticides, increase the selectivity and avoid pest resistance.- Bioaccumulation and bioconcentration: It is necessary to avoid soil and groundwater accumulation and bioconcentration in the flora and fauna.- Highly dependency of water availability: An increase of water use efficiency and water management is essential due to water risks.In this context, nano and biotechnology strategies have recently gained more interest in the agricultural sector compared to conventional agricultural techniques. AGRO4AGRI seeks to provide ground-breaking and Safe and Sustainable by Design solutions for plant nutrition and protection consisting of nano and biobased controlled delivery fertilisers and plant biostimulants, and target-specific biopesticides based on RNAi technology, both for enhanced agrochemicals use efficiency. AGRO4AGRI involves R&D and validation stages, aiming to minimize in the long term the use of agrochemicals in agriculture in more than 50% to be aligned with the Farm to Fork Strategy, among other EU initiatives.

The marine environment is largely affected by global change and wild harvesting of marine bioresources does not represent a sustainable supply of these biomolecules. The main sources of the high-value biomolecules are corals, sponges, algae, involving industrial end-users in the medical and pharmaceutical, food, and cosmetic sectors. Therefore, new approaches are urgently needed in marine biotechnology as microbial engineering has not fully met the expectations for producing the marine bioactives identified in invertebrates and seaweeds. Recent advances in thesynthetic biology of terrestrial natural products are offering unique opportunities to supply bioactives of terrestrial origin.  Omics technologies have also transformed the way the complexity of the marine holobiont can be viewed and today the integration of omics data such as genomics and metabolomics can increase our understanding of the functioning and processes of living organisms including their metabolic pathways. COMBO will allow the transfer of knowledge from terrestrial to marine biotechnology through the engineering of marine metabolic pathways using Omics approaches. The rationale behind COMBO lies in the power of synthetic consortia of host cells and microbial cells based on the concept of holobiont and auxotrophy.  To this end, we will exploit the recent advances in co-cultures systems.  Indeed, the development of synthetic consortia has been shown to support specific ecological dynamics,  promote microbial species growth,  and syntheses of valuable chemicals.  COMBO will therefore expand the potential offered by underused marine sponges and seaweeds known to produce bioactives such as terpenoids and alkaloids for the cosmetic and pharmaceutical markets.|10.3030/101135438|Cluster 6

This threat is particularly significant for protected, endangered and threatened species (PETS), including marine mammals, seabirds, turtles and sensitive fish species, with their bycatch threatening marine ecosystem health. While bycatch of PETS is recognized as a significant issue, advances in fully understanding risks to PETS have been limited, due to current inability to effectively monitor wide ranging, highly mobile and cryptic species. There has been further lack in advancement in approaches to reduce such risks. These issues all hinder Member States ability to eliminate and significantly reduce bycatch. MarineBeacon will respond to these challenges, working across a regional seas scale to identifying where significant gaps in understanding lie, and adopt innovative approaches to produce the knowledge and tools to better understand bycatch risk and vulnerability. Next generation monitoring tools will be produced and developed to improve understanding of the distribution and abundance of PETS in addition to the levels in which they interact with fisheries. Cutting-edge mitigation tools and techniques will then be extensively tested across diverse fisheries and regions to ensure transferable outputs are generated to significantly mitigate against bycatch risk. MarineBeacon will facilitate the uptake and adoption of its targeted outputs by policy, management, and industry by adopting a stakeholder centered approach, engaging and collaborating with stakeholder throughout the project to producing best acceptable solutions. Importantly, MarineBeacon will ensure long-term applicability and impact of outputs beyond the lifetime of the project through the production of a suite of decision support tools to ensure all measures to better monitor PETS and mitigate against bycatch risk are effectively targeted.|10.3030/101135237|Cluster 6

Compared to other QPIC techniques, glass yields extremely small interface losses (<5%) – ideal for modular, scalable architectures connecting multiple chips – with speed, affordability, and optimization for end-user goals. Incorporating high-performance single-photon sources, superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, and electronics enabling reconfigurable state manipulation via control of an exceptionally large number of cryogenic-detector channels (200) and phase shifters (1000), we will create an end-to-end quantum photonics platform. We will implement Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), leading candidates for near-term advantage, for which our platform is ideally suited. We will develop software for end users to translate their VQAs into FLW circuits, with error mitigation to enhance QPIC performance. Our principal use case is solving problems in the design of lithium-ion batteries to achieve improvements in capacity and efficiency crucial for attaining EU technological and sustainability goals. QLASS will attain substantial advancement both towards the specific QPIC objectives as well as glass development, with associated novel SNSPD processes, benefitting the wider community and enabling new quantum devices with performance far exceeding other platforms.

This trend makes ever more urgent the boosting of battery recycling for several reasons, the most important ones being: i) the preservation of the environment, and ii) the development of a circular economy reducing the demand for virgin materials and the Europe’s dependence from third countries. All these crucial aspects need to be handled through the development of new recycling and re-use concepts, fostering demonstrable effects in terms of efficiency and sustainability. RENOVATE aims at developing and demonstrating new circular economy solutions for the European battery value-chain, targeting the re-use of 100% of in-specification cell fractions (e.g. metallic foil, graphite, electrolyte, fluorinated compounds and cathode active materials) within the battery value chain, fostering a closed-loop circular approach that can reduce battery material waste going to landfill, increase the availability of battery precursors in the European battery eco-system, and demonstrate new added-value business cases for recyclers and battery materials users. All recycled materials will be recovered over all potential streams (pre-customer scraps and End-of-Life products). The ultimate goal is to support the green and digital transformation of the European battery industry to increase its competitiveness and promote its just growth path. Holistic, flexible, and closed-loop processes for the recycling of EoL batteries based on both low and high energy density chemistries will be designed and validated to allow real and easily implementable “net zero carbon” process. A specific aim will also be smart re-integration of the side streams (e.g. waste chemicals/solvents) in the recycling processes and/or in in other industrial activities to minimize the residues coming from batteries production.|10.3030/101137745|Cluster 5

Wind turbine blades are made up of composite materials that allow lighter and longer blades with optimised aerodynamic shape, which boost the performance of wind energy. However, current wind blade composites exhibit relatively short life spans, are problematic to repair and are notoriously difficult to recycle. As we continue to build more wind farms these issues pose a major problem to achieving a truly sustainable European wind energy sector.The EOLIAN project will develop an innovative new smart wind turbine blade, manufactured from an infinitely recyclable circular platform chemistry, with in-mould electronics (recyclable sensors and heating actuators) that detect damage early before it becomes a major issue. EOLIAN is the breakthrough that will make obsolete single-use engineering resins in wind blade manufacture. Our unique blade is made using vitrimers, a new class of polymer combining the performance of thermosets with the processability and logistical benefits of thermoplastics. Vitrimer resins enable circularly recyclable composite structures (1), and the option of post-cure processing provides unprecedented manufacturing flexibility (2), but also repairability (3). These three features will provide a truly sustainable and step-change approach in how wind turbine blades are maintained, re-shaped for new applications and/or recycled in a circular economy.In the project we will validate these performance claims through the manufacture, testing and benchmarking of a smart sensor-assisted vitrimer-based composite 14m prototyped wind blade. Additionally, we will prove circular recyclability through the manufacture of 2nd generation composites with (i) recycled fibers and recycled vitrimer obtained after the chemical recycling by vacuum infusion; (ii) with composite parts produced by SMC (Sheet Mould Compound) following mechanical recycling.|10.3030/101147532|Cluster 5

The modularity and versatility of the system is a unique function and provides its own competitive benefit, it is designed for flexible use of neutral (green methane, green methanol) and zero-emissions (hydrogen, ammonia) fuels, and it can reach up to 50-55% electrical efficiency and 73-76% overall electrical+thermal efficiency. In this sense, it can be operated to optimise the electrical power generation on-board a ship, but also to be operated in Combined Heat and Power (CHP) mode, both modes will be assessed through two case studies.MARPOWER will optimise the design of the turbomachinery components which are essential and specifically conceived for using zero-emission fuels. Accordingly, it will develop a new fuel-flexible combustion concept, in which the combustor will be able to run on 100% hydrogen or other neutral or zero-emission fuels without any additional changes to the combustion system. High efficiencies will be additionally fostered by the integration of an Active Magnetic Bearings (AMB) technology for control of long high-speed shafts. The impacts generated from MARPOWER will allow the creation of a value chain for the construction and deployment of the energy conversion system in different types of ships worldwide, achieving significant economic, social, and environmental impacts, and therefore boosting European leadership in the maritime sector: The project can contribute significantly to the decarbonisation of the maritime sector avoiding the emission of more than 2.3 million of tonnes of CO2 into the atmosphere.|10.3030/101138341|Cluster 5

The project will design, construct and optimize a prototype rotary kiln that enables optimized heat transfer and gas-solid interactions, ensuring effective metal recovery.A key aspect of the Dust2Value project is the integration of digitalization and machine learning techniques for process modelling and optimization. The project will leverage machine learning algorithms trained on kinetic data from thermogravimetry to create an accurate and comprehensive process model. This model will be used for the dimensioning of the prototype and will be further developed into a digital twin, providing a real-time representation of the physical process. The digital twin will enable continuous monitoring, analysis, and optimization of the process, ensuring optimal performance, and facilitating the rapid implementation of improvements. This advanced approach to process modelling will significantly enhance the Dust2Value process optimisation, driving innovation in the field of steelmaking residue recycling.|10.3030/101138742|Cluster 4

HCM affects all ages - it is the leading cause of death among young athletes. Comorbidities due to gene mutations include altered vascular control, and, caused by HCM, ischemia, stroke, dementia, or psychological and social difficulties. Multiple causal mutations and  variations in cellular processes lead to highly diverse phenotypes and disease progression. However, HCM is still diagnosed as one single disease, leading to suboptimal care. SMASH-HCM will develop a digital-twin platform to dramatically improve HCM stratification and disease management, both for clinicians and patients. Multilevel and multiorgan dynamic biophysical and data-driven models are integrated in a three-level deep phenotyping approach designed for fast uptake into the clinical workflow. SMASH-HCM unites 8 research partners, 3 hospitals, 3 SMEs, and a global health-technology corporation in collaboration with patients to advance the state of the art in human digital-twins: including in-vitro tools, in-silico from molecular to systemic level models, structured and unstructured data analysis, explainable artificial intelligence - all integrated into a decision support solution for both healthcare professionals and patients. SMASH-HCM delivers new insights into HCM, improved patient care and guidance, validated preclinical tools, and above all, a first HCM stratification and management strategy, validated in a pilot clinical trial, and tested with end users. Thus providing a cost efficient and effective solution for this complex disease. SMASH-HCM develops a strategy towards fast regulatory approval.  In reaching its goals, SMASH-HCM serves as a basis for future digital-twin platforms for other cardiac diseases integrating models and data from various scales and sources.|10.3030/101137115|Cluster Health

Nevertheless, most biofuels currently are made from food-related sources and have a negative impact on food production. The development of cost-effective solutions to minimize carbon waste and inhibit biogenic effluent gas emissions in sustainable biofuel production processes is still at an early stage of development. FLEXBY intends to go significantly boost this development by producing advanced biofuel through an innovative, cost-efficient process that will reach TRL5. At FLEXBY we will produce biofuel using biogenic waste from microalgae cultivated in domestic wastewater as well as the oily sludge from refineries.  This residual biomass will undergo a microwave pyrolysis treatment to produce three different fractions: bio-liquid, pyro-gas, and bio-char. The bio-liquid fraction will be converted to jet, diesel, and marine bio-fuels (heavy transport biofuels) through a versatile and innovative Hydrogen-free Hydrodeoxygenation. The gaseous fraction will be converted to bio-hydrogen through a steam-reforming water gas-shift process (WGS) and preferential CO oxidation (PrOx). Both liquid and gaseous biofuel will be tested and validated in fuel cells to produce electricity, along with an evaluation of their respective suitability for the transport sector. FLEXBY promotes a circular economy by recycling biomass residues and all sub-products obtained during the project.  The combined expertise of the industrially-driven consortium (formed by 1 LE, 4 SMEs, 2 universities, 1 non-profit association, and 2 RTOs) from 5 different countries will be able to achieve these objectives. In terms of impact, FLEXBY will increase the use of advanced biofuels in the heavy transport sector, mitigating climate impact in key areas of the global economy|10.3030/101144144|Cluster 5

Accelerating particles to higher energies will always require a large amount of energy. In a society where energy sustainability is critical, keeping energy consumption as low as reasonable possible is an unavoidable challenge for both research infrastructures (RIs) and industry, which collectively operate over 40,000 accelerators. Based on state-of-the-art technology, the portfolio of current and future accelerator-driven RIs in Europe could develop to consume up to 1% of Germany's annual electricity demand. With the ambition to maintain the attractiveness and competitiveness of European RIs and to enable Europe’s Green Deal, we propose to Innovate for Sustainable Accelerating Systems (iSAS) by establishing enhanced collaboration in the field to broaden, expedite and amplify the development and impact of novel energy-saving technologies to accelerate particles. For many frontier accelerators superconducting RF (SRF) systems are the enabling technology. iSAS will innovate those technologies that have been identified as being a common core of SRF accelerating systems and that have the largest leverage for energy savings to minimize the intrinsic energy consumption in all phases of operation. In the landscape of accelerator-driven RIs, solutions are being developed to reuse the waste heat produced, to develop energy-efficient magnets and to operate facilities on opportunistic schedules when energy is available. The iSAS project has a complementary focus on the energy efficiency of the SRF accelerating technologies. This will contribute to the vital transition to sustain the tremendous 20th century applications of the accelerator technology in a green and energy conscious 21st century.|10.3030/101131435|Other

SOLVE will tackle these challenges by deciphering the mechanisms of induction of long-lasting immunity and evaluating new vaccine platforms. To achieve this goal, an integrated plan has been developed including six pillars: 1) Vaccine discovery and design; 2) Head-to-head evaluation of the immune response and long-lasting immunity induced by four vaccine platforms in the preclinical setting; 3) Validation of the pre-clinical results in an experimental medicine trial (EMT); 4) Immune mechanisms of long-lasting immunity; 5) Data Science; 6) Determinants of population adherence to vaccination. New immunogens including key mutations from most recent variants in RBD and Nucleocapsid sequences highly conserved across Sarbecoviruses,  will be delivered through: antigen-targeting to dendritic cells (DC), i.e., CD40 DC-targeting, nanoparticles, a MVA vector and 2nd generations of mRNAs. SOLVE will evaluate in depth the immunogenicity of these vaccines in the preclinical setting, and in an EMT testing two vaccines, i.e., CD40 DC-targeting and MVA with available GMP clinical lots. SOLVE will benefit from the most advanced technologies to identify the mechanisms of long-lasting immunity. Integrative analyses of high throughput data, including from large cohorts, will provide insights for identification of factors (demographics, vaccines, immunity) which impact quality and longevity of immunity. SOLVE will investigate stakeholders’s perspective on the acceptability of large vaccination campaigns to improve implementation of next generation of vaccines in a preparedness track.

It is very energy-efficient (80-85%), is geographically independant and uses no critical raw materials. It enables 8-12 times longer storage duration than Li-ion, with LCOS of 80 – 137 €/MWh, depending on the use-case. This is lower than pumped hydro, the lowest-cost commercial electricity storage. Its lifetime of 20-30 years is 2 – 3x longer than Li-ion. A TRL4 prototype and the digital twins of 3 full use-cases will be delivered: (i) ceramics plant storing excess, on-site PV power in a micro-grid and industrial waste-heat for continuous green H2 production and self-consumption, (ii) a smart-grid, and (iii) a geothermal power plant.  The ETES integrates: (i) a novel heat-pump design with a coefficient of performance of 50% the theoretical maximum, (ii) a novel thermal energy storage system with energy density of 90 kWh/m3 (+30%), containing phase-change material in a novel metallic Kelvin cells-like foam and (iii) ORC with novel operating parameters. New digital tools will optimise the energy management of the storage and facilitate investment decisions by potential end-users taking LCA and technico-economic factors into account.

To achieve this, Euclid will observe over a third of the sky with high resolution imaging and spectroscopy, which will establish “the” reference map of the extra-galactic celestial sphere for decades to come. The giant archive produced will be a goldmine to study the history of the formation and growth of galaxies over the age of the Universe, driving answers to many fundamental science questions on the co-evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes, the interaction between stars, gas, and galactic nuclei in galaxies at cosmic noon, and excelling in the discovery of rare objects including gravitational lenses. However, the richest gold veins are also the most difficult to exploit: the tools developed for Euclid’s primary science will not be enough to open the rich legacy for the astronomical community. We therefore propose ELSA to explore new methodologies and create cutting-edge pipelines, tools and algorithms. Our ambitious goal is to push the boundaries of spectroscopic analysis to the limits, uncovering hidden details of even the faintest and rarest galaxies measured by Euclid. We will leverage state of the art machine learning to efficiently handle the high-dimensional data and reveal the underlying physical processes they encode. This will need dedicated computing resources and highly motivated researchers versed in the most advanced techniques, that will work with our team of leading experts in the field of galaxy evolution to reveal the treasures preserved in the Euclid vault. Our machine learning will be supplemented by citizen science, enormously extending the reach of ELSA’s impact. ELSA will be a forge of knowledge and advanced tools that will not be confined within the boundaries of our teams, but shared with the whole scientific community and beyond to foster new projects and unforeseen discoveries.|10.3030/101135203|Cluster 4

There are many technologies available for converting waste heat into electricity but at industry scale the adaptation of these solutions is scarce. Specific barriers such as efficiency and cost of these renewable technologies and difficulty in integrating these systems in the production lines limit their extensive adoption as heat recovery technologies in the industry. Innovative approaches to improve the efficiency with new modular technology are therefore urgently required that can be retrofitted in production lines to save energy and reduce greenhouse gas emission. The primary goal of INFERNO is to develop a new hybrid platform system based on the integration of thermophotovoltaics (TPV), metasurface collector (MetaS) and thermoelectric generators (TEG), which will eventually contribute to a breakthrough in sustainable energy harvesting from industrial waste heat. We will develop new infrared sensitive low bandgap (<0.7 eV) TPV cell with integrated plasmonic metamaterials to increase the photon adsorption to improve the overall heat-to-electricity conversion efficiency to 25% and high performance TEG devices made of earth-abundant materials with an efficiency of 10%. With an innovative design strategy, all these components will be integrated to develop a modular, hybrid energy harvesting system that can be easily integrated in the production lines for converting waste heat into usable electricity. To accomplish the project's ultimate goal, expertise in materials research, modelling, cell fabrication, thermoelectricity, and electronics is merged in a pan-European scale. The integrated hybrid system and its components (TPV, MetaS, TEG) invented by INFERNO will be tested in 3 pilot demonstrations in 3 countries to convert waste heat into electricity to reduce greenhouse gas emission.|10.3030/101160642|Cluster 5

For example, producing new metal powder in state-of-the-art processes has only 30-50% yield, with excess powder sent to lower-value uses or remelted at great energy loss. The incorporation of scrap into additive processes represents challenges in manufacturing process stability and the stability of powder production processes. Difficulty in recycling some advanced alloys that are used in additive processes makes such circular thinking difficult.REPAM aims to combat these issues across the entire process chain, starting with an industrial powder producer and researchers to deploy advanced sensors in new ways to optimise powder production process monitoring and enable the creation of new process models, including artificial intelligence. Recycling processes are also targeted by exploring the transformation of material waste into wires for directed energy deposition and scrap into powders for directed energy and powder bed processes. The manufacturing processes themselves are considered with advanced monitoring tools in combination with artificial intelligence models to enable real-time process control and optimisation, which will permit the use of a wider range of scrap in such processes. Materials design principles shall be applied to make alloys more robust for recycling purposes. Finally, the reconditioning of old or degraded metal powders is investigated to develop the technology for industrial readiness and thereby offer a more sustainable way to reuse these powder instead of simply melting them in bulk processes. All of these steps offer a reduction in materials losses and an acceptance of a wider range of materials into additive processes, in line with the work programme.REPAM aims to put the additive transformation on a sustainable footing and allow Europe to lead the way in this green paradigm shift, with the associated competitive and security benefits for the entire value chain.|10.3030/101178659|Cluster 4

A solution based on wavelength conversion from a 1µm laser will be matured, ensuring EU supply chain independence for power laser emission in the 1.5-3µm range. Such breakthrough laser will build the foundation of next greenhouse gases (GHG) spaceborne sensors by Integrated Path Differential Absorption Lidar (IPDA), by which GHG of interest can be probed in the 1.6μm or 2μm eye-safe regions. To meet the stringent spectral, spatial beam, and power properties required, efficient and versatile wavelength converters such as Optical Parametric Oscillators (OPOs) pumped by mature 1μm power lasers are key enabling technologies. This is also the approach in the European Methane Remote Sensing Lidar Mission (MERLIN).SIROCO will mature innovative critical optical space technologies to TRL6, including a hybrid fiber/bulk 1μm laser combined with a new Backward Wave OPO (BWOPO) concept. This will lead to a simplification shock compared to the state of the art, as no optical cavity is required (higher robustness and easier integration), nor any OPO seed source (higher compactness and simplicity in wavelength control). It will increase EU competitiveness by faster integrated, less risky, more sensitive future space IPDA.SIROCO will develop nonlinear crystals to ensure an EU supply chain, which are key components for various applications (general laser physics, IPDA emitters, quantum applications). Their exploitation path towards future space LIDAR and quantum communications will be delivered through two public technical roadmaps.SIROCO is a 4-year 3MEuros valued action, gathering renown research & academic organisations and SMEs, and supported by an Advisory Board with experts from the European Space research, Atmosphere Science and Quantum communities.|10.3030/101189542|Cluster 4

Relatively small adjustments to existing hydropower facilities by retrofitting reversible pump turbine technology would allow the European electricity storage capacity to increase by 22TWh/y or more. The aim will be achieved by: i) Validated innovative mechanical solutions to TRL4-5 for larger-scale pumped, longer-duration storage of electricity in existing high head Reservoir-to-Reservoir (RtR) and low head Run-of-River (RoR) hydropower facilities. ii) Mapping untapped hydropower sources for long term electricity storage in Europe increasing the availability, robustness and safety of energy storage solutions. The novel technologies will enable the operators to run hydropower stations in a more efficient, cost effective and flexible manner than today also adapting to the energy system. This is without changing the regulating heights or volume of the reservoir/river reaches following the European Green Deal priorities. Also, turbine manufacturers can introduce new components for cost-effective retrofitting of pumped storage. The technology will be validated with detailed LCA and by consideration of CAPEX and OPEX of potential future plant. The 1st innovation is based on unique design solutions for a retrofittable reversible pump turbine technology enabling a cost-effective solution free of cavitation, enhanced flexibility, and reduced losses. The 2nd innovation is enabled by digital twins including hydraulic and sediment dynamics for pumped-storage. These tools give detailed information about the status of the current storage increasing the availability and robustness of the mechanical storage of electricity in existing RoR and RtR systems adapting to, for example, predictions of generation of intermittent electricity from wind and solar. Practically this will imply new storage of electricity in existing reservoirs and river stretches.|10.3030/101136176|Cluster 5

FLUWS validates up to TRL 5 a novel TES concept that ensures elevated thermal efficiency with minimum environmental impact thanks to on the one hand the upcycling of waste and residual materials from the ceramic industry and the use of air as heat transfer fluid and on the other thanks to building on previous consortium know-how in the development of new cost-effective radial packed-bed TES and materials for high-temperature applications. The new FLUWS TES will enable more flexible and modular CSP systems as it will have embedded electric heaters driven by renewable electricity and will be designed for easier integration with compact gas Brayton cycles, thus facilitating the provision of additional services from CSP to the grid and widening the applications of CSP as a competitive technology for combined heat and power (CHP) in the industrial sector.FLUWS addresses key technological challenges: development of high-temperature solid TES media materials based on upcycling of waste and residual material streams; Production of bricks-shaped TES materials via low energy demanding extrusion processes; Development of high temperature (≥800°C) packed bed TES with embedded electric heaters with enhanced performance and reducedstructural challenges facilitating upscaling and commercial uptake; Development of high-temperature TES with minimal environmental impact and maximized circularity along the full value chain; Deployment of comprehensive modelling suites for industry and grid operators to maximize the dispatchability of CSP plants, improving their role in the energy sector and the variety of provided services.|10.3030/101147257|Cluster 5

The traditional path is electronic components such as silicon chips (e.g., microcontrollers) integrated onto flexible substrates called “hybrid integration” or “flexible hybrid electronics” in integrated smart systems. We believe that this approach is not a viable long-term solution for future high-volume, low-cost and conformable integrated smart systems.  Our vision is an integrated smart system that is built with only flexible electronic components including analogue circuitry, digital logic and memories. We call such a system a “Natively Flexible Integrated Smart System” or NFISS. NFISSes will enable new products in the Fast Moving Consumer Goods and healthcare wearables that have not been possible before because conventional silicon chips are too costly, too bulky and not conformable. The project will develop a flexible microcontroller unit (FlexMCU), which is the key component missing to enable NFISSes. The FlexMCU must be a low-power chip integrating a variety of functionality to address the functional requirements of the applications in FMCG and healthcare wearables. A novel hybrid complementary low-power thin-film transistor technology (100x per-transistor power reduction) will be developed to fabricate the FlexMCU in a sustainable flexible chip fab with 100-1000x less environmental footprint. The FlexMCU design is tailored to a specific domain composed of an open-source RISC-V based processor with built-in security features, an analogue frontend, on-chip memory and other peripherals. Then, the FlexMCU will be assembled using novel assembly and bonding methods onto a flexible film, which is, in turn, integrated onto a flexible substrate along with other flexible electronic components to build the first proof-of-concept NFISS that will be validated on two healthcare wearable applications.|10.3030/101134936|Cluster 4

SPECTRUM will boost the sustainability of IWW treatment, converting waste into a valuable solar fuel, through an efficient photocatalytic remediation process coupled with H2 cogeneration. Matching the energy grade between the solar spectrum and the conversions, the system uses the UV for photocatalytic H2 production with synergistic degradation of pollutants, infrared for generating thermal energy and visible-near infrared light for PV electricity, allowing to achieve higher solar conversion efficiency. SPECTRUM concept will go beyond the current state of the art through i) the development of low cost, sustainable photocatalysts with focus on dual-functional photocatalysis processes, i.e H2 production and pollutants degradation, and considering the easy recovery and reuse of the catalysts and ii) development of spectral splitting solutions to separate IR part of the solar spectrum allowing the PV cells to be thermally decoupled from the thermal absorber, generating high-temperature heat without compromising the electrical efficiency. Integrate optical, thermal, and electrical subsystem of SPECTRUM hybrid solar collector will be design and developed aiming to reach an effective total management and distribution of the solar radiation. Two hybrid solar collector prototypes for low and medium temperature (SPECTRUM-LT and SPECTRUM-HT) will be constructed and tested under outdoor conditions.

However, these policies have had unintended and unforeseen effects, creating new inequalities and/or aggravating existing ones. Those primarily affected are social groups already at risk and EU’s most vulnerable regions. Public authorities and policy-makers at local, national and European levels therefore need evidence-based understanding of these inequalities and concrete ways to prevent and/or mitigate these. The READJUST project aims to suggest policy options for overcoming these (potential) trade-offs between efficiency and equality in twin transitions, in the key sectors of mobility and agri-food. The green and digital policies are intended to level the field for attaining SDGs; however, they may return uneven distribution of access to the transitions and their benefits. READJUST aims to suggest options for overcoming the perceived trade-off between efficiency and equality in policy and to make inclusive growth a reality. Policymakers portray a future that is green and digital for the EU, and they aim to continuously contain the unintended consequences of the green and digital transitions in terms of inequalities. Generating zero negative effects on the climate can be efficiently achievable by twining green and digital transitions. Nonetheless, individually and jointly, the transitions might widen the existing inequality gaps. This project aims to contribute to policies for fair and just twin transitions to mitigate existing inequalities driven by the twin transitions and minimize the transitions’ unintended consequences for equality.

Permafrost thaw releases large quantities of organic matter and contaminants into the environment. Contaminants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants and microbiological agents locked in permafrost, are a risk for both human and animal health. In addition, permafrost thaw dramatically impacts infrastructure in local communities with wide-ranging consequences for health, economy, and society. Yet the social, physical and health components of permafrost thaw have traditionally been studied in isolation, leading to inadequate policy options that ignore the holistic nature of the threat. There is a need for an integrated and participatory approach to the complex issues at the overlap between climate change, permafrost thaw, infrastructure damage, contaminants, health and well-being and for solutions founded on the cultural, natural and social frameworks of local communities.ILLUQ is an interdisciplinary project rooted in participatory research with local stake- and rightsholders. Its mission is to tackle this need by providing the first holistic approach to permafrost thaw, pollution, One Health and well-being in the Arctic and delivering timely products on the risks from contaminant release, infrastructure failure and ecosystem changes to stakeholders.ILLUQ’s endeavor is a direct answer to the pressing needs of communities on potentially disappearing permafrost. It targets the missing link between studies performed by scientists, engineers and consultants in local communities and solutions with local stake- and rightsholders focusing on the long-term implications of decision-making in the context of permafrost thaw, a time frame generally overlooked in existing governance frameworks.|10.3030/101133587|Cluster 6

According to the UN Sustainable Development goals, the European Green Deal, the EU Biodiversity strategy and other European and national level Directives and strategic regulations, pollution is one of the main drivers of biodiversity loss. The risks resulting from the use, release and effects of chemical on the environment is addressed in a plethora of EU-level Directives and regulatory strategies, each with specific (chemical) targets and protection aims. There is, however, concern that such a fragmented approach does alleviate the threats of chemicals to biodiversity and ecosystem services. To protect genetic and functional biodiversity from pollution impacts, a paradigm shift is needed. This transformation should move beyond the current fragmented Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) performed in specific regulatory silos, e.g., Plant Protection Products (PPPs)regulation for pesticides, REACH for industrial chemicals and Biocides framework for Biocidal chemicals, towards a harmonised and systems-based ERA applicable to all chemicals, species and land use functions. To make this advance, SYBERAC will provide ways forward to rationalise the current silo-based Protection Goals into high-level system-based Protection Goals and to operationalise their use within systems-based ERA robust and broadly applicable ERA structures. Six case studies, overarching different silos of current ERA will provide proof-of-concepts of the developed approaches. Based on targeted stakeholder engagement, in close cooperation with other relevant projects on the topic, results and outcomes will be disseminated towards a wide audience, including national and EU level regulatory institutions, industrial partners but also land managers, farmers and conservation bodies.|10.3030/101135213|Cluster 6

In recent decades, there has been a significant increase in, for example, reproductive disorders and gender incongruence, along with a decline in fertility rates, all of which may be linked to EDC exposure. The EU has highlighted EDCs as substances of high concern and aims to minimise exposure of humans and the environment by improving regulation and policy. Yet there remain important gaps in our understanding of the impact of exposures at critical life stages and the tools for identification and ultimately regulation of EDCs. The MERLON project addresses these gaps, bringing together world-leading experts in endocrinology, chemical safety assessment, developmental and molecular biology, epidemiology, toxicogenomics, toxicokinetics modelling, regulatory toxicology, psychology, psychiatry and research ethics. We will investigate EDC-mediated effects on sexual development, providing human data on the role of EDC exposure during fetal development and changes in mini-puberty, connecting to puberty, reproductive function, and gender incongruence using existing biobanks and cohorts. MERLON will apply and develop 3R-compliant New Approach Methodologies (NAMs) focusing on sexual development and function and the effects of EDCs thereon. Our cutting-edge approaches incorporate transcriptomics, pharmacokinetic models, biomarker identification and the use of Adverse Outcome Pathways, which we will utilize to develop a roadmap for EDC identification, making the best use of NAMs into the future. With MERLON, we will engage EU risk assessment bodies, public health authorities, regulators, scientists and researchers, healthcare providers and citizens.

The key potential of the concept of Product Service System (PSS), besides radical improvements in the use of products, is a reduction of environmental footprint of products and services. The overall footprint of PSS is still insufficiently investigated. The services within PSS are an important, insufficiently used source of (digitalized) data on the product and its use. It is likely that digital means facilitating provision of consistent “track and trace” information on the origin, composition and entire life cycle not only of a product but of all services offered and used around the product, will offer important contribution towards achievement of full circularity for manufacturing. The key idea of PSS-Pass is to investigate how extension of DPP to Digital Product Service System Passport (DPSSP) can be effectively achieved and how it will allow for improved circularity of the manufacturing industry. The overarching hypothesis is that LCA underpinned by Machine Learning (ML) methods and informed by dynamic data paves the way to more accurate LCA while supporting PSS life cycle decision making. The collected and sharable data from DPSSP will allow to effectively apply ML as well as Digital Twin (DT) for more reliable decision-making processes concerning circularity of PSS.

EAC is notorious for its highly aggressive biological behavior leading to invasive disease and early metastases. The only way to reduce mortality is through treatment in early stage of the cancer. EAC has a well recognized premalignant precursor lesion identified as esophageal metaplasia, or Barrett’s Esophagus (BE), which offers important opportunities for treatment in early stages of cancer which may reach 5 years survival rates up to 80%. However, these patients need to be monitored constantly for timely intervention in case of disease recurrence or metastases. The problem is that after endoscopic treatment up to 30% of cases will develop recurring cancers or even present with metastases, which requires additional endoscopic treatments or surgery. Currently it is impossible to predict which of the treated BE patients with  will have stable disease and which will recur or progress to invasive cancer. As a consequence all treated patients need to remain in frequent endoscopic surveillance. This leads to over-treatment of a large group of BE patients and under-treatment of those with more aggressive disease. There is a low cost effectiveness of endoscopic therapies, low quality of life of patients and poor satisfaction of care providers. An accurate risk stratification method for early AEC in BE patients is therefore an unmet clinical need. The ambition of the ENDEAVOR  consortium is to implement an innovative risk stratification method, which encompasses minimally invasive cell collection supplemented by single cell genomic analysis to address this specific need. Taking into account patient characteristics, gender dimensions, an optimal model model will be tested in a randomized controlled prospective trial. Future implementation of this method will reduce health care costs, increase quality of life and satisfaction of health care providers. This action is part of the Cancer Mission cluster of projects on Diagnostics and Treatment (diagnostics).|10.3030/101136935|Cluster MISS

CHI is a major cause of hypoglycemic brain injury with intellectual disability, epilepsy and cerebral palsy. As no registered causal therapy exists, management of CHI aims at increasing blood glucose levels causing severe side effects in all patients while life-threatening frequent hypoglycaemias remain. Removal of hyperfunctioning beta cells by pancreatectomy leads to insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) and maldigestion of food, changing one disease for another with severe secondary morbidity. Management of CHI is choosing between evils and symptomatic management is partially effective in only some sub-types. CHI also represents a major burden for families, because of disability but also as a result of continuous monitoring and correction of glucose levels for many years, requiring permanent alertness. Health problems and economic decline occur in most parents. A normal life is not feasible for families with babies with CHI. LightCure consortium partners have demonstrated the feasibility of selectively targeting beta cells using exendin 4 (EX) labelled with a photosensitizer (700DX) specifically binding to beta cells. This photosensitizer can be activated by light of a certain wavelength and will produce radical oxygen species leading to cell damage, a principle called targeted photodynamic therapy (tPDT). In this project we will build on existing cutting-edge technology exclusively available to the consortium partners and perform human proof of concept studies demonstrating safety and efficacy of tPDT with EX700DX. We will deliver the proof-of-concept that after injection of EX700DX, minimally invasive tPDT leads to normalization of blood glucose levels avoiding morbidity, enabling a normal life for babies with CHI and their families.|10.3030/101080327|Cluster Health

The utilization of hydrogen as sole energy source offers the opportunity to eliminate aviation CO2 emissions entirely. Furthermore, a reduction in NOx emissions of at least 50% is enabled by ingesting steam produced by a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) into the hydrogen-fuelled gas turbine (GT). FlyECO will develop a simulation and evaluation framework in which the optimal architecture definition of the IPPS, the key enabling integration technologies and necessary controls concepts can be explored, investigated closely and advanced towards TRL3 through Proof-of-Concept (PoC) demonstrators. A Commuter/Regional aircraft application was chosen as a use case to develop the propulsion system with more than one megawatt power. In particular, the energy management and distribution strategies will be developed for both quasi-steady-state and transient operation. In addition, PoC for the IPPS and the reduction in NOx emissions will be provided via two demonstrators: (1) a sub-structured test-rig emulating the cycle-integrated hybrid-electric propulsion system and (2) a high-pressure combustor with steam ingestion.  The outcome of FlyECO will be comprise of:-An advanced simulation platform to analyse the impact of the SOFC integration on a hydrogen GT-A validation methodology for novel energy and power management strategies for the IPPS architecture-A controls approach for the IPPS, including specialised local control for components and subsystems as well as global control-A set of key coupling technologies develop developed to enable the integration of the SOFC with a GT under consideration safe design process in aviation based on ARP 4754A -An open-access database on hydrogen combustion with steam injection|10.3030/101138488|Cluster 5

I-UPS validate up to TRL 5 a first-of-a-kind high-temperature heat pump (HTHP), based on Stirling cycles and exploiting a non-toxic, inert, zero ozone depletion potential (ODP) and zero global warming potential (GWP) fluid, able to deliver decarbonized heat up to 400°C. No other commercial alternatives are available achieving this heat delivery temperature at efficiencies higher than 100%. The developed heat pump provides enhanced performance thanks to the optimization of key subcomponents, such as optimized static and dynamic sealing solutions and compact heat exchangers enabled by genetic algorithm based design optimization and additive manufacturing techniques. I-UPS provides also a seamless integration of the developed high temperature heat pump in flexible energy systems including molten salts based thermal energy storage (TES) for on-demand decarbonized industrial heat based on RES electricity. This effective integration will be attained thanks to the design and development of purposely-optimized compact heat exchangers (pressurized gas to molten salts) which will ensure reliable high temperature operation and fast ‘plug-and-play’ installation. The integrated heat pump configuration proposed by I-UPS will enable higher modularity, flexibility, and efficiency for heating decarbonisation also leveraging waste heat recovery and contributing to the circularity of the industrial sector. I-UPS will contribute to heating flexible electrification, permitting a broader penetration of RES and facilitating and maximizing the market penetration of heat pumps in industrial contexts.|10.3030/101147078|Cluster 5

However, the key problem of the industry transition towards climate neutrality is that the combined response of demand, global trade and industrial production to policy measures is highly complex.The aim of the AMIGDALA project is to facilitate decision makers in governments and in the EU’s industries to define and evaluate pathways towards climate neutrality, circularity and sustainability. In this project we combine insights in decision-making with integrated modelling of scenarios to analyze transformation pathways. We analyze decisions-making in government and in industry by the control options that they have such as incentives, regulatory measures and investments in capital projects to contribute to the Green Deal’s objectives. We deliver an integrated model to represent EU industry’s transformation pathways up to 2070 and cover historical developments from 1990. We develop a method to combine established models of separate domains and let them operate as-one. This integrated model shows the combined effect of control options on economy, trade, energy, materials flow, biomass and industrial production on an EU systems-level and within a global context. On a local-level we use models to analyze the decisions by industry clusters to invest in transformative solutions and utility operators to build infrastructure. With the integrated model we run scenarios that we develop on the basis of the control options of decisionmakers to achieve industrial transformation towards climate neutrality. The integrated model allows to analyze the effect of framework conditions on the uptake of transformative solutions and products and on energy demand, emissions, and material use.

Key to the GO-Forward approach is to simulate geological processes for pre-drill assessment of reservoir structure and properties, calibrated to geological or geophysical data, rather than extrapolating the properties from those data with geostatistical methods. To this end, GO-Forward focuses on extending and further developing, testing and demonstrating the added value of forward modelling methods originally developed for hydrocarbon exploration, including stratigraphic forward modelling (SFM), diagenesis forward modelling (DFM) and fracture network forward modelling (FFM), to be used for exploration in different geothermal settings of high relevance for Europe. First, the developed approaches will be tested and calibrated in areas with abundant subsurface information and production data, to prove conceptually the applicability of the methods and reproducibility of the results, to optimise and de-risk geothermal exploration. Calibrated model approaches are subsequently applied in areas with limited data availability to demonstrate their capability to increase pre-drill Probability of Success (POS). To support the workflow and further reduce exploration costs, GO-Forward advances ML-based and computational methods to enhance (existing) (sub)surface information for calibration, uncertainty quantification and data assimilation, and (upscaling) routines for flow simulation, DNSH, and techno-economic performance assessment for POS and Value of Information (VOI).  In addition, GO-Forward addresses public awareness of geothermal developments already at the early stages of exploration. By including novel approaches to citizen engagement and stakeholder dialogue, we aim to increase the societal readiness level of geothermal exploration as the first step of geothermal developments.|10.3030/101147618|Cluster 5

Experience from the existing wind farms shows the importance of a proper micrositing of the wind turbines as well their efficient interconnection within the farm. In addition, bringing wind farms together into clusters toward a wind power plant concept might induce long distance negative interaction between the farms, reducing their expected efficiency. This might happen both on- and offshore. The high amount of connected wind power and the expected increase during the coming years, requires that this technology has to be prepared to take a more important role as of its contribution to the reliability and security of the electricity system. The present proposal, WinDTwin, targets to develop and validate an offshore wind farm digital twin (DT) for highly accurate prediction of power production and energy demand of the end user.  The DT will give users tailored access to high-quality information, services, models, scenarios, forecasts, and visualisations, as a central hub for offshore wind decision-makers.

In a context of human-driven global changes, these threats will intensify with larger and more frequent epidemics, potentially leading to pandemics, will expand with geographic spreading of the mosquito vectors, and will multiply with the likely emergence of yet-unknown flaviviruses. Improving pandemic preparedness and response to these emerging and re-emerging diseases is a top priority both for the EU and WHO. However, there are no effective interventions against all flaviviruses and current vaccines targeting flaviviral proteins have severe safety issues. FLAVIVACCINE’s high-impact/low-risk/disruptive ambition is to develop a novel, broad-spectrum, mosquito saliva-targeted vaccine candidate that protects against multiple different flaviviruses and is ready for clinical evaluation by building upon an experimentally-validated proof-of-concept. FLAVIVACCINE will define the immunogenicity of the pan-flavivirus target, develop and characterize a vaccine candidate against multiple flaviviruses, and prepare it for clinical evaluation. To reach these goals, FLAVIVACCINE creates a unique interdisciplinary environment of ten public and private institutions, including Universities, Research Institutions and a Vaccine Developer, from seven countries to cover all the required scientific expertise and knowledge in cell biology, virology, immunology and vaccinology. The pan-flavivirus vaccine candidate that will be validated against dengue, yellow fever, Zika and West Nile diseases in several preclinical models, together with the knowledge and networks resulting from FLAVIVACCINE, will have short- and long-term impact on the EU ability to combat epidemic and pandemic viral threats, and protect communities and citizens in the EU and around the world.|10.3030/101137006|Cluster Health

EXPOSIGNALZ project aims to delineate the impact of a selection of environmental pollutants on brain health throughout life and their role in dementia especially Alzheimer’s disease (AD) representing about 70% of dementia cases. Through interdisciplinary approaches, integrating experimental and epidemiological studies, our objectives are to: 1) Identify environmental pollutants likely to have neurotoxic effects and pro-amyloidogenic properties predictive of a neurodegenerative trajectory related to AD using in vitro screening models; 2) Characterize pollutant signatures associated with brain aging and AD in biological matrices of 4 European population-based cohorts of various age groups; 3) Understand the mechanisms of action of pollutants identified in the in vitro screenings and those found in biological signatures, using AD-iPSC and AD preclinical models; 4) Explore the impact of pollutants on early neurodevelopment as a factor of susceptibility for later neurodegenerative diseases using brain organoids and gestational contamination models and 5) Disseminate knowledge to policy makers, to the relevant stakeholders and general public in order to define guidelines for disease prevention and take actions for population’s health.

Exploiting the microbiomes' full potential is essential to ensure sustainable and nutritious food and feed as they are important players throughout the food system, ranging from primary production, where microbes improve plant growth and health, to food production based on microbial processes and ultimately linking to the interactions between animal/human microbiomes and host health. MICROBIOMES4SOY focuses on the soya bean model system, an important protein-rich crop. The project will develop second-generation microbiome applications that sustain crop productivity and improve soya bean seeds' nutritional value and safety under different environmental conditions. MICROBIOMES4SOY will test the effect of dietary intervention based on soya bean-derived protein on the human gut microbiome and health and elaborate microbiome-informed dietary recommendations. The project will also employ microbiome-based solutions to develop novel aquafeeds and establish their effects on the fish gut microbiome and health.MICROBIOMES4SOY consortium comprises 18 partners from ten countries contributing complementary expertise on soil, plant, human and animal microbiomes, bioinformatics, modelling,  crop production, aquaculture, food/feed production, food systems mapping and scientific communication.|10.3030/101083671|Cluster 6

With a 25% prevalence in the general population, MASLD is currently the most common liver disease, and a major healthcare and economic burden. While hyperlipidaemia, obesity and insulin resistance are the major risk factors for MASLD and contribute to its rising prevalence, growing evidence suggests that exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) can initiate and/or cause progression of MASLD. EDC-MASLD will focus on investigating the impact of environmental exposure to EDCs on the internal exposome (metabolome, gut microbiome, epigenome, proteome, immunome) and degree of liver damage in MASLD in prospective study settings, with a focus on the period of transition to progressive stages of MASLD. EDC-MASLD is particularly focused on interactions between EDC exposure, sex, genotype, diet, socioeconomic and lifestyle factors, via the data and biosamples available in the unique European NAFLD Registry, comprising over 9,000 patients with histologically characterised MASLD. EDC exposure studies will be performed in murine models of MASLD, zebrafish models, and human 2D/3D in vitro models, with an aim to understand respective mechanisms-of-action and to develop novel EDC screening tools. The EDC-MASLD consortium has diverse and complementary expertise in the domains of hepatology, endocrinology, toxicology, exposome research, metabolomics, systems biology, environmental economics, and communications & technology research, with respective PIs being global leaders in their fields. Taken together, EDC-MASLD will significantly contribute to the actions centred on identification and mechanistic assessment of impact of EDCs, strategies to monitor and reduce exposure, and regulatory actions that could better protect human and environmental health.|10.3030/101136259|Cluster Health

To this end, P2F will integrate information from paleoenvironmental  proxy data, from Earth system models (ESMs), and from rigorous theoretical approaches. Being able to reconstruct past climate evolution is a necessary step for enhancing our capacity to look into the future and, therefore, extensive improvements of state-of-the-art ESMs are needed. So far, ESMs are mainly calibrated and validated with respect to the instrumental records of the last ~170 years of relatively stable climate, while the Earth’s longer-term history is characterised by an interplay of gradual climate change, variability and critical transitions between competing states, with profound impacts on climate subsystems, ecosystems, and civilisations. Understanding the leading dynamical processes and feedbacks and in particular improving our ability to model and anticipate critical transitions in the climate and ecosystems is key to project future climate change on spatio-temporal scales relevant for societies, ecosystems and the planet. In this context, P2F will critically advance our ability to understand and anticipate the main climatic and societal impacts of the ongoing climate crisis. Specifically, P2F will extend the reach of Earth System Models and demonstrate a step change in the model development cycle of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), by providing fully paleo-informed models for future projection and producing a portfolio of plausible future climate change scenarios that are constrained by documented past climate changes and abrupt transitions. Finally, P2F will efficiently disseminate research outputs and engage key stakeholders in dialogue to ensure appropriate synergies are at attained.|10.3030/101184070|Cluster 5

This innovative approach is based on the well-established Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystems (WEFE) Nexus approach, which emphasizes the primacy of ensuring water security when designing, installing and managing agroforestry systems.  The translation of this conceptual agroforestry management approach into real-world applications is supported by an array of technical and non-technical innovations. These include cutting-edge measurement methods and tools to accurately assess environmental and socio-economic impacts, scalable nature-based intervention strategies to facilitate sustainable exploitation of natural resources, and novel business models designed to secure long-term livelihoods of local communities engaged in agroforestry practices.  The efficacy of the novel approach and supporting innovations will be rigorously tested and validated through a series of large-scale pilot demonstrations set to take place in key locations across Africa, including Tunisia, Ghana, and Ethiopia. Novel community-led engagement methods are used to support the co-design of the demonstrators, and ensure deep acceptance of the innovation within local communities.  Expected outcomes will contribute to bridging the agroforestry data gaps in Africa, increased crop yield, doubling of farmers’ annual incomes, and creation of new carbon sinks across previously degraded territories. An ambitious post-project exploitation plan executed in partnership with EU and African policymakers and civil society groups foresees the immediate and widespread uptake of resulting innovations across African Union (AU) member countries and beyond by 2030.  Innovation adopters will significantly enhance their communities’ resilience to threats posed by the climate emergency, and stimulate highly sustainable socio-economic development across their region.|10.3030/101182176|Cluster 6

To achieve this, STAGE is proposing a life-course approach to better understand ageing with multi-morbidity, providing evidence-based solutions to support the transformation of healthcare to address the profound health and demographic challenges ahead.  The approach capitalises on European collaborations of longitudinal cohorts and biobanks spanning the entire life-course, actioning exposome and disease networks trajectory analysis, as well as, the biology of ageing, to explore how a person develops ageing with multi-morbidity. The project objectives integrate an ethical, social, historical, and infrastructural framework; environmental, epidemiological and biological life-course approaches; artificial intelligence powered integrated person-centred solutions and applications; cohort-based clinical studies; and a FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) life-course health and geospatial data portal with robust management, dissemination, engagement and exploitation activities.STAGE's evidence-based methods will translate into a person-centred prevention and care intervention in longitudinal cohorts in Finland and Germany, co-designed with citizens, patients, healthcare providers, SMEs, and policymakers. It will also embed social sciences and humanities and engage stakeholders to develop a neighbourhood healthy ageing index, person-centred predictions of multi-morbidity, and healthcare and policy recommendations.

In view of the possible irreversibility associated with such events and the potentially catastrophic global consequences on climate, ecosystems, and society, the precautionary principle demands thorough investigation of the underlying mechanisms, compound or cascading impacts, and associated risks. ClimTip will substantially advance the process understanding of possible Earth system Tipping Elements (TEs). It will provide the methodological framework for characterising and constraining potential TEs from paleoclimate, observational and model data, for identifying unknown tipping potential from observations and models, and for quantifying resilience and changes thereof in climate and ecosystems, including early-warning of forthcoming transitions. Earth system models (ESMs) are the primary tool for projecting the risk of large-scale tipping events and ClimTip will substantially improve their representation of suggested TEs. This will enable the identification of safe operating spaces for a stable Earth system by characterising key Earth system TEs in terms of their critical thresholds and rates, hysteresis and overshoot potential via empirical data and ESMs, taking into account the associated uncertainties. As a unique climate service, ClimTip will provide global high-resolution bias-corrected climate fields for large-scale tipping events based on storylines of tipping in comprehensive ESMs. The associated impacts on climate, ecosystems, biodiversity, agriculture, society and economy will be assessed globally and put in relation with the Paris Agreement and the EU Biodiversity Strategy 2030.

To achieve this growth requires FOW to be economic, sustainable and supported by a wide supply chain. TAILWIND is focussed on station-keeping systems of FOW, which comprise mooring lines and anchoring systems. The project will unlock identified opportunities for cost reduction, reduced environmental impact and material use, and also supply chain diversification.TAILWIND will integrate new experimental evidence, novel technologies and innovative methodologies, across mooring lines and anchors, and will quantify the resulting benefits for the overall floating system design. All innovations will be sustainable-by-design, integrating environmental, societal and economic benefits. For mooring lines, new synthetic rope technologies will be mechanically and chemically tested to demonstrate their suitability for small-footprint ‘taut’ moorings, validating new response models. For anchoring, geotechnical centrifuge testing and advanced soil element testing will underpin two advances: (i) new response models for the long-term loading particular to FOW, and (ii) the validation of novel anchors types including cluster anchors that are “silently” installed from small vessels and are suited to shared moorings. The new technologies for mooring lines and anchors will allow smaller and lighter station-keeping systems, manufactured and installed by a wider supply chain. TAILWIND will distill the models into system optimisation tools, unlocking further floater optimisation and cost reduction.

However, there is an increasing concern due to livestock farming’s contribution to environmental pollution since it generates more than 1.4 billion tonnes/year of manure leading to significant greenhouse gases (GHG) and air pollutants emissions(NH3, NOX)as well as to soil and water contamination caused by hazardous manure chemicals and biological contaminants (called here emerging contaminants). In this context extensive effort has been carried out for years to assess the detrimental effects of farming systems and to develop abatement methods to be implemented. However, despite major advancements, many fundamental issues are beyond the scope of existing legislation.  The main objective of NUTRITIVE is to develop a decision-making tool (DSS, decision support system) able to define the most efficient and sustainable (in its three pillars: environmental, economic, and social) manure management strategies for a given livestock farm limiting manure air emissions as well as soil and water contaminants.

The project will innovate on Si heterojunction (SHJ) solar cell technology, currently holding the c-Si power conversion efficiency record of 26.81% for single junction c-Si solar cells. By targeting higher efficiencies and lower costs, TERASUN paves the way for mass production of improved SHJ solar cells. TERASUN will develop: (i) nanophotonic structures on module cover glass to minimise reflection (maximise absorption) and improve anti-soiling properties and improving the overall performance of the module, which will allow for reduced silicon consumption and higher efficiencies; (ii) innovative texturisation, including micro- and nanostructures for optimal light-trapping to enable the use ultrathin crystalline Si solar cells; (iii) novel heterojunction contacts based on metal-oxide layers implemented in interdigitated back contact (IBC) SHJ solar cells for very high efficiencies, and low-cost surface passivation for advanced surface structures; (iv) low-cost metallisation, replacing silver with copper to move towards a technology ready for terawatt production scale; and (v) direct bandgap architectures for implementation in IBC SHJ solar cells. These developments will help with approaching the fundamental limit of 29.43% on cell level and reducing cell-to-module losses for optimised energy yield. The strategic choice of materials (Cu, Al-doped Zn oxide, Sn oxide) will reduce the costs and supply chain risks. Environmental, economic and performance data associated with the developments will be gathered, evaluated and used to develop an algorithm based on multi-disciplinary design optimisation to create the TERASUN decision support tool (DST).

Innovations on transistor technologies, following Moore’s law, can in part compensate for this rise and improve sustainability by providing more energy-efficient electronics. However, the energy-efficiency of CMOS is limited by the Boltzmann physics, which sets a lower bound on the operating voltage, and thereby the power. To sustain miniaturization, and improved performance of electronics, new transistor technologies are needed that can overcome this limit.AttoSwitch will develop a novel cold-source transistor technology that uses the intrinsically cold carrier distribution of Dirac semimetals to overcome the Boltzmann limit. The main objective is to develop a scalable Dirac transistor technology based on large-area integration of 2D and 3D Dirac materials, e.g. graphene and CoSi, and the realization of high-performance device demonstrators at technologically relevant length scales. Key demonstrators are based on graphene integrated with MoS2 and WSe2 channels, as well as novel work on 3D Dirac semimetals. Our methodology includes development of device process modules and extensive material and device characterization. Systematic modeling using new simulation frameworks plays a key part to benchmark and provide a road map for the technology. Our ambitious performance targets include a subthreshold swing of 35 mV/decade and a switching energy of 4 attojoule.The project links to ongoing European efforts, such as the 2D-experimental pilot line, and the goals set by the European Chips Act.

In particular, research at some of the large-scale facilities, such as particle accelerators, which are either hosted or used at European Level are very energy intensive. Power usage may reach 100 MW or more, with energy consumptions comparable to small towns. To make progress in science, these large-scale infrastructures are essential despite their energy consumption requirements. At the same time, our society is faced with the enormous challenge to transition into a carbon-neutral economy, and to minimize our footprint in terms of energy usage from non-renewable sources, and our output of substances which burden the environment. For this reason, research infrastructures need to develop and use energy efficient technologies. The way we operate our infrastructures needs to be re-evaluated. Intelligent solutions which reduce energy consumption need to be developed. Through intelligent algorithms the energy usage of our infrastructures needs to be adjusted to the available resources, such as renewable energy, and should help in providing an overall stable energy supply to society.The RF2.0 consortium vision is to design and operate accelerators in the way that they can run safe and stable anytime on 100% renewable energy supply, i.e., almost independently from the public power grid.To achieve this vision, comprehThis project’s originality lies in the comprehensive analysis of large research infrastructures’ energy management problem, from component to system level, both at experimental physics and energy engineering level, and in developing and testing in realistic environments of possible corrective actions.The RF2.0 project will involve 6 world renowned research infrastructures for the acceleration of particles, of which 5 of European Interest, an energy technology lab, and 4 SMEs focused on the (co-)development and technology transfer of new energy solutions.|10.3030/101131850|Other

Earth system models (ESMs) are essential tools for projecting climate change, providing important information to decision makers. However, confidence in predicted climate change is undermined by a number of uncertainties; (i) ESMs disagree on how much the Earth will warm for a given increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (Earth’s equilibrium climate sensitivity); (ii) how much emitted CO2 will stay in the atmosphere to warm the planet (half the CO2 emitted by humans has been absorbed by the land and ocean) and (iii) how much excess heat in the Earth system will enter the ocean interior, delaying surface warming (~90 % of the heat in the Earth system goes into the ocean). Central to these uncertainties are poorly understood, and poorly modelled, Earth system feedbacks, in particular cloud feedbacks, carbon cycle feedbacks and ocean heat uptake. Poor representation of these phenomena degrades the accuracy of ESM projections, with implications for anticipating future climate extremes and societal impacts. We aim to improve the representation of these feedbacks in ESMs, reducing uncertainty in global warming projections. We propose a multidisciplinary approach, focused on “learning” how to accurately describe processes underpinning these feedbacks, through a fusion of observations with advanced machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). Such data and approaches, constrained by the laws of physics, will deliver a step change in the accuracy of Earth system models.

A third of all the offshore capacity installed could be floating since this technology unlocks wind potential in deeper waters at greater distances offshore. Technological trends have advanced towards high-voltage direct current (HVDC) as a mature solution over long-distance transmission. Dynamic export cables float in the water and carry power from the moving platform to the grid. A key challenge is these cables need to accommodate combined electro-mechanical-thermal stresses. No HVDC dynamic export cables currently exist and industry views this as a critical bottleneck for floating offshore wind development. Therefore, this is a key enabling technology for secure grid integration of large-scale and long-distance floating offshore wind power plants.HVDC dynamic cables for floating offshore applications present unique challenges and risks from technical, environmental, operational, and economical perspectives. To address these complex inter-disciplinary issues, this project brings together a consortium from academic experts, manufacturers, users, and insurance advisors.

The target portfolio of products will be fish oil, fish protein hydrolysates, bacteriocins, pigments, vitamins, collagen and calcium-rich powder, targeting food products, additives, supplements and nutraceuticals. The cascade conversion processes will vary with the feedstock heterogeneity, comprising pre-treatment, oil green extraction, proteolytic fermentation (protein hydrolysis), fermentation with hydrolysates as substrate, and a portfolio of downstream processes. The proteolytic fermentation will be guided by computational biology, using models to search new candidate enzyme-producing bacteria. The fish protein hydrolysates obtained in the fermentation will be used, first, as food supplement due to their bioactive properties, and second, as substrate for supporting a second fermentation, to obtain high-value bioproducts, namely bacteriocins and astaxanthin, as food additives, and vitamin B12, as food supplement. Novel genome-scale metabolic models will be used to link substrate composition to the desired bioproducts via inspection of metabolic pathways and selecting optimal microorganisms. In a zero-waste aim, the fermentation side-streams will be valorised (bones by extraction and calcination, and residual biomass by anaerobic digestion).

UPBEAT will create novel UQ methods and tools to support the production of safer and more innovative aircraft structures and engines while reducing uncertainties in product and engineering lifecycles. The project focuses on metal-composite hybrid aerospace engine parts that are lighter, more durable and cheaper. Innovative design solutions for hybrid interfaces can be achieved using metal additive manufacturing (AM) bonded with carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Advanced models of materials and processes will be developed using sophisticated in-situ and ex-situ monitoring and metrology. In aviation engines, the outlet guide vane (OGV) is an essential component that helps de-swirl the flow field from the fan. The OGV's stiffness is crucial as it influences the engine's performance and includes a major load path from its core to the wing. The OGV with two types of CFRP vanes and titanium end fittings will be used as a demonstrator. By combining AM with advanced in-situ melt pool monitoring and characterization (micro-CT & nanoindentation), digital models will be used to optimize design and manufacturing processes and increase awareness on efficiency, safety and risk. This will result in 20-40% weight reduction and 50-70% fewer defects. Streamlined product development reduces qualification time by 30-40% and costs by 25-35%. In-line quality assurance support lowers manufacturing costs by 30-50% and time by 20-30%.

Important knowledge gaps concerning processes and drivers of GHG exchanges persist, that further hamper our predictive capabilities. The absence of coherent approaches to collect, interpret and integrate data on terrestrial GHG stocks and processes into predictive models limits the EU’s ability to monitor ecosystem services and thus to reach its climate ambitions, including the Paris Agreement of Climate Convention and European Green Deal.NextGenCarbon aims to develop a novel framework for advancing our understanding of the European GHG budget. To reach this goal, we will: 1) improve and enrich existing measurements on ecosystems; 2) assimilate these data into state-of-the-art modelling frameworks; 3) create seamless scenario prediction systems; and 4) provide guidance to policymakers on the magnitude, evolution of and future risks to GHG fluxes. Our exceptional multidisciplinary consortium links leading experts developing the next generation of ground and EO-driven observations, with several groups at the cutting edge of carbon cycle and land surface modelling, plus teams pushing the boundaries of data assimilation, complex system modelling, forest management and disturbance monitoring, land-use and GHG inventories, and communications. It also involves active engagement with diverse stakeholders, including landowners and managers, GHG exchange modelling community, international community related to environmental monitoring, climate policy support and GHG inventory experts, and policymakers. In doing so, NextGenCarbon will pave the way for high-accuracy and seamless estimates of national to continental and global GHG budgets from the recent past into the coming decades, making a vital contribution to EU's climate mitigation strategies.|10.3030/101184989|Cluster 5
